[Romans 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
