[Romans 6:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/6?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
