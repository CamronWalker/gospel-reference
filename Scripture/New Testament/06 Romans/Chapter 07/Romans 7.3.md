[Romans 7:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/7?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
