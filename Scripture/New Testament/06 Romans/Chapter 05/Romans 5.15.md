[Romans 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.
