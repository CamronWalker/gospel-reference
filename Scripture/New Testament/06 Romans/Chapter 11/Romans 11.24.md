[Romans 11:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/11?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
