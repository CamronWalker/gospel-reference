[Romans 11:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
