[Romans 13:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/13?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.
