[1 John 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
