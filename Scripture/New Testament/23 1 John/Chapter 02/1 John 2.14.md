[1 John 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
