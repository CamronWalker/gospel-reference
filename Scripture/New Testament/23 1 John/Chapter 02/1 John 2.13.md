[1 John 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.
