[1 John 2:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-jn/2?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.
