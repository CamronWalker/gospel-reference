[2 Corinthians 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.
