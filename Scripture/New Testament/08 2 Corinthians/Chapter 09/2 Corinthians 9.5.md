[2 Corinthians 9:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/9?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.
