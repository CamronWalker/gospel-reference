[2 Corinthians 11:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
