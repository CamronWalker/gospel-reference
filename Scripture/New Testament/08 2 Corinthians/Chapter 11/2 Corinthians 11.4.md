[2 Corinthians 11:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.
