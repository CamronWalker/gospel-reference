[2 Corinthians 7:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/7?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.
