[2 Corinthians 12:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
