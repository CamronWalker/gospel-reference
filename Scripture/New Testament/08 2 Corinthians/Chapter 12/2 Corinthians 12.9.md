[2 Corinthians 12:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
