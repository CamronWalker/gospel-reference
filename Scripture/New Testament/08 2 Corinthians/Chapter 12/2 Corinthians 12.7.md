[2 Corinthians 12:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
