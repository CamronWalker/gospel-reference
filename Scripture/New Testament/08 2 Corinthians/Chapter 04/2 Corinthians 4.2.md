[2 Corinthians 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.
