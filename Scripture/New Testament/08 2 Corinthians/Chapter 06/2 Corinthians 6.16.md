[2 Corinthians 6:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-cor/6?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
