[Philippians 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.
