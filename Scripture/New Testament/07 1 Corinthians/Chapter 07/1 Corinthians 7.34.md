[1 Corinthians 7:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
