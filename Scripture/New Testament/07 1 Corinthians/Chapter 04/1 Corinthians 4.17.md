[1 Corinthians 4:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/4?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.
