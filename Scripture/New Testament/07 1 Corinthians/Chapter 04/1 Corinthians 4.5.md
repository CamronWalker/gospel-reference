[1 Corinthians 4:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/4?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.
