[1 Corinthians 4:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/4?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.
