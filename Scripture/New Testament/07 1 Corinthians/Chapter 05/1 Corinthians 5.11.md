[1 Corinthians 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
