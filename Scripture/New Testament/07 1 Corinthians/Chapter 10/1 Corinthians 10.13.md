[1 Corinthians 10:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
