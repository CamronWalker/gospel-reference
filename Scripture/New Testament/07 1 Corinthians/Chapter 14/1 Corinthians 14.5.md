[1 Corinthians 14:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.
