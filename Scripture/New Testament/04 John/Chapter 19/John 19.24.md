[John 19:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/19?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
