[John 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
