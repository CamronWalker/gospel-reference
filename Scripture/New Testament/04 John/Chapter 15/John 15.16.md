[John 15:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.
