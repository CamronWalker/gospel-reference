[John 18:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/18?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.
