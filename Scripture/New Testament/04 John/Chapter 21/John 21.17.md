[John 21:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
