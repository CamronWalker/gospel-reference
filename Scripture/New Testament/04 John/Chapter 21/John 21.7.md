[John 21:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea.
