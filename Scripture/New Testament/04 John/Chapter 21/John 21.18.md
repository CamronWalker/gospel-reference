[John 21:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/21?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
