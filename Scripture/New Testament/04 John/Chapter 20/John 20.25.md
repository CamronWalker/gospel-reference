[John 20:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/20?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
