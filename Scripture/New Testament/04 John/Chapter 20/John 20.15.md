[John 20:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/20?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
