[John 8:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/8?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
