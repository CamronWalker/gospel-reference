[Galatians 2:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/gal/2?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.
