[Mark 11:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/11?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith.
