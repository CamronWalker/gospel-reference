[Mark 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Ghost.
