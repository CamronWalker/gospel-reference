[Mark 8:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/8?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
