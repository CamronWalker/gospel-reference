[Mark 3:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
