[Mark 12:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/12?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?
