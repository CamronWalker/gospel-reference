[Mark 12:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/mark/12?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.
