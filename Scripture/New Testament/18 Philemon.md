[Philemon 1:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) PAUL, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, ^c1v1

[Philemon 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house: ^c1v2

[Philemon 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^c1v3

[Philemon 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers, ^c1v4

[Philemon 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints; ^c1v5

[Philemon 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus. ^c1v6

[Philemon 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother. ^c1v7

[Philemon 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient, ^c1v8

[Philemon 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ. ^c1v9

[Philemon 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds: ^c1v10

[Philemon 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me: ^c1v11

[Philemon 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels: ^c1v12

[Philemon 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel: ^c1v13

[Philemon 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly. ^c1v14

[Philemon 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever; ^c1v15

[Philemon 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord? ^c1v16

[Philemon 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself. ^c1v17

[Philemon 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account; ^c1v18

[Philemon 1:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides. ^c1v19

[Philemon 1:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord. ^c1v20

[Philemon 1:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say. ^c1v21

[Philemon 1:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you. ^c1v22

[Philemon 1:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus; ^c1v23

[Philemon 1:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers. ^c1v24

[Philemon 1:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philem/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ^c1v25
