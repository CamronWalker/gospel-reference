[Luke 12:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/12?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.
