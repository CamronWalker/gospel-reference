[Luke 12:58](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/12?lang=eng&id=p58#p58) ¶ When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
