[Luke 6:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock.
