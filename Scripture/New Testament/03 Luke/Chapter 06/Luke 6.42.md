[Luke 6:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.
