[Luke 6:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.
