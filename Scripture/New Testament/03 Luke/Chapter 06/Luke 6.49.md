[Luke 6:49](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p49#p49) But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
