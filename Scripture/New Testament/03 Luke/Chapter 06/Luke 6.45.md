[Luke 6:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/6?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
