[Luke 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place.
