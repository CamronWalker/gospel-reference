[Luke 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee.
