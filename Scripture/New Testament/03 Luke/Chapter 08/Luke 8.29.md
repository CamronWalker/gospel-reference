[Luke 8:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/8?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the wilderness.)
