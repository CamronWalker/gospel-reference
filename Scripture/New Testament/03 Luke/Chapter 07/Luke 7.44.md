[Luke 7:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/7?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
