[Luke 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.
