[Luke 10:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/luke/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
