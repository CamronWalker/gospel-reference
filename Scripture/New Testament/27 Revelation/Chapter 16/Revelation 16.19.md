[Revelation 16:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/16?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
