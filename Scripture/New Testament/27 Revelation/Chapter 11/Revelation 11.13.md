[Revelation 11:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
