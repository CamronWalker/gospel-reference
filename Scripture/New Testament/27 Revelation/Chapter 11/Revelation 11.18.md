[Revelation 11:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/11?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.
