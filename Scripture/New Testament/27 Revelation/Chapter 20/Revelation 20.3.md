[Revelation 20:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/20?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.
