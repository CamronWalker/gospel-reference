[Revelation 20:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/20?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
