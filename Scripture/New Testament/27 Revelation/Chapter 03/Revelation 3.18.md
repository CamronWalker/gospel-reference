[Revelation 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.
