[Revelation 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
