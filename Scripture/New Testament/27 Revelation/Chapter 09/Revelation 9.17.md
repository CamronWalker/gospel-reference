[Revelation 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
