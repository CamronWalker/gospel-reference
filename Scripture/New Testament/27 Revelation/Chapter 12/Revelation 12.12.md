[Revelation 12:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.
