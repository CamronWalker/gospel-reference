[Revelation 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
