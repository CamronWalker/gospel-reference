[Revelation 17:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/17?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
