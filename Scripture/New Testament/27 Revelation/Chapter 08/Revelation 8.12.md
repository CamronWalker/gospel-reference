[Revelation 8:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.
