[Revelation 13:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/13?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.
