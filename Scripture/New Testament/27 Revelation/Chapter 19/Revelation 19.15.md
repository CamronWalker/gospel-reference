[Revelation 19:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/19?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
