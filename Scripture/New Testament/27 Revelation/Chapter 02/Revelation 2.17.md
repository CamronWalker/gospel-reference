[Revelation 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
