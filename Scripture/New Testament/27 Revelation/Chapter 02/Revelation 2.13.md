[Revelation 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
