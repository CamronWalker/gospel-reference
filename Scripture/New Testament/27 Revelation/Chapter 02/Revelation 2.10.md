[Revelation 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rev/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
