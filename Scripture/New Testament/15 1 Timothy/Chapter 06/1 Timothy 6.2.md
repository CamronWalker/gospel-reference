[1 Timothy 6:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-tim/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.
