[Acts 12:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/12?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
