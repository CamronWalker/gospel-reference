[Acts 12:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/12?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
