[Acts 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
