[Acts 28:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/28?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
