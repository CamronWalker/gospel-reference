[Acts 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
