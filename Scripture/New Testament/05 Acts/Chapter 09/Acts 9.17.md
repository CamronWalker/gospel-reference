[Acts 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.
