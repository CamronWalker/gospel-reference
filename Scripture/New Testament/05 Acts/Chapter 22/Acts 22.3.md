[Acts 22:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/22?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
