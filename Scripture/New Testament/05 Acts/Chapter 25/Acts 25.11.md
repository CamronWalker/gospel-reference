[Acts 25:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/25?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
