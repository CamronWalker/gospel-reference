[Acts 25:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/25?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.
