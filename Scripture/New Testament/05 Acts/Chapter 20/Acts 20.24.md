[Acts 20:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/20?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
