[Acts 23:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/23?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
