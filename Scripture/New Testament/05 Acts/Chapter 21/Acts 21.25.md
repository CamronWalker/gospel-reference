[Acts 21:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/21?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from strangled, and from fornication.
