[Acts 21:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/acts/21?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
