[Collosians 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth: ^c1v6

[Collosians 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ; ^c1v7

[Collosians 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: ^c1v15

[Collosians 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: ^c1v16

[Collosians 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. ^c1v17

[Collosians 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. ^c1v18

[Collosians 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: ^c1v27

[Collosians 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. ^c2v12

[Collosians 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it. ^c2v15

[Collosians 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days: ^c2v16

[Collosians 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ. ^c2v17

[Collosians 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, ^c2v18

[Collosians 2:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, ^c2v20

[Collosians 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/col/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) (Touch not; taste not; handle not; ^c2v21
