[Hebrews 8:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/8?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
