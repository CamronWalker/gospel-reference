[Hebrews 13:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/13?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
