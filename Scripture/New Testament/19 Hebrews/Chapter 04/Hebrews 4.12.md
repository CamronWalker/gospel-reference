[Hebrews 4:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
