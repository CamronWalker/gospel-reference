[Hebrews 11:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
