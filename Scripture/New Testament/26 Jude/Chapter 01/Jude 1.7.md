[Jude 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/jude/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.
