[Jude 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/jude/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.
