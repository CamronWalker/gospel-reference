[2 Peter 3:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/2-pet/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
