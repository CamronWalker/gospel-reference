[James 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
