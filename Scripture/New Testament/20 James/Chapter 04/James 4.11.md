[James 4:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/james/4?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
