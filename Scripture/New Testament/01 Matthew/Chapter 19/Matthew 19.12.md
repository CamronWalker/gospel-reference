[Matthew 19:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/19?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
