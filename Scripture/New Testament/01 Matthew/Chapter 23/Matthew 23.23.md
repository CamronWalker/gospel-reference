[Matthew 23:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/23?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
