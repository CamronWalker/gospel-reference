[Matthew 12:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/12?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.
