[Matthew 12:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/12?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.
