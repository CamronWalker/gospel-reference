[Matthew 4:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/4?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
