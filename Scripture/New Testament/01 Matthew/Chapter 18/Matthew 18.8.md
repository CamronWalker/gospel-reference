[Matthew 18:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/18?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.
