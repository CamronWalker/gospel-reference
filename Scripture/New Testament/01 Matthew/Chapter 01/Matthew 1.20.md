[Matthew 1:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
