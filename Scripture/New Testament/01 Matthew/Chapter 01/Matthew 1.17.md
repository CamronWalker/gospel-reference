[Matthew 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
