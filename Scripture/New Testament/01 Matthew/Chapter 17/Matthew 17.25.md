[Matthew 17:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?
