[Matthew 17:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
