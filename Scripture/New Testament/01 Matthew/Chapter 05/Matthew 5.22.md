[Matthew 5:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
