[Matthew 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
