[Matthew 6:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Â¶ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
