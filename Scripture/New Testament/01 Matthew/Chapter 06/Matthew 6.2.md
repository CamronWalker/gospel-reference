[Matthew 6:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
