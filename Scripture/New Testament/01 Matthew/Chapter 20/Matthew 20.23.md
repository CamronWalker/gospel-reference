[Matthew 20:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/20?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.
