[Matthew 13:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/13?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.
