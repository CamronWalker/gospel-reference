[Matthew 13:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/13?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
