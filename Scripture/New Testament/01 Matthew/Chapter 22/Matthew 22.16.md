[Matthew 22:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/22?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.
