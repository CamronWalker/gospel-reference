[Matthew 21:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/21?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe him.
