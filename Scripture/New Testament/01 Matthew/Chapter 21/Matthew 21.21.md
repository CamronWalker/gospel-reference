[Matthew 21:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/21?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done.
