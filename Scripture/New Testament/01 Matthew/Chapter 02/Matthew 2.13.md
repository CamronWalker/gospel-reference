[Matthew 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.
