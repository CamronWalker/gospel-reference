[1 Corinthians 1:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) PAUL, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, ^c1v1

[1 Corinthians 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: ^c1v2

[1 Corinthians 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ. ^c1v3

[1 Corinthians 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ; ^c1v4

[1 Corinthians 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge; ^c1v5

[1 Corinthians 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: ^c1v6

[1 Corinthians 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: ^c1v7

[1 Corinthians 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^c1v8

[1 Corinthians 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord. ^c1v9

[1 Corinthians 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. ^c1v10

[1 Corinthians 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. ^c1v11

[1 Corinthians 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. ^c1v12

[1 Corinthians 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul? ^c1v13

[1 Corinthians 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; ^c1v14

[1 Corinthians 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. ^c1v15

[1 Corinthians 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other. ^c1v16

[1 Corinthians 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. ^c1v17

[1 Corinthians 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. ^c1v18

[1 Corinthians 1:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent. ^c1v19

[1 Corinthians 1:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world? ^c1v20

[1 Corinthians 1:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. ^c1v21

[1 Corinthians 1:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: ^c1v22

[1 Corinthians 1:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness; ^c1v23

[1 Corinthians 1:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God. ^c1v24

[1 Corinthians 1:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men. ^c1v25

[1 Corinthians 1:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: ^c1v26

[1 Corinthians 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty; ^c1v27

[1 Corinthians 1:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are: ^c1v28

[1 Corinthians 1:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) That no flesh should glory in his presence. ^c1v29

[1 Corinthians 1:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: ^c1v30

[1 Corinthians 1:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/1?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. ^c1v31

[1 Corinthians 2:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. ^c2v1

[1 Corinthians 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. ^c2v2

[1 Corinthians 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. ^c2v3

[1 Corinthians 2:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: ^c2v4

[1 Corinthians 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. ^c2v5

[1 Corinthians 2:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: ^c2v6

[1 Corinthians 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory: ^c2v7

[1 Corinthians 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. ^c2v8

[1 Corinthians 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him. ^c2v9

[1 Corinthians 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. ^c2v10

[1 Corinthians 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. ^c2v11

[1 Corinthians 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. ^c2v12

[1 Corinthians 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. ^c2v13

[1 Corinthians 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. ^c2v14

[1 Corinthians 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man. ^c2v15

[1 Corinthians 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.PrevHomeNextThe First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the CorinthiansUpChapter 3 ^c2v16

[1 Corinthians 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. ^c3v1

[1 Corinthians 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. ^c3v2

[1 Corinthians 3:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? ^c3v3

[1 Corinthians 3:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? ^c3v4

[1 Corinthians 3:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? ^c3v5

[1 Corinthians 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. ^c3v6

[1 Corinthians 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. ^c3v7

[1 Corinthians 3:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. ^c3v8

[1 Corinthians 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building. ^c3v9

[1 Corinthians 3:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. ^c3v10

[1 Corinthians 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. ^c3v11

[1 Corinthians 7:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) There is difference also between a wife and a virgin.

[1 Corinthians 7:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Nevertheless, he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. ^c7v37

[1 Corinthians 7:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better. ^c7v38

[1 Corinthians 7:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/7?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord. ^c7v39

[1 Corinthians 11:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. ^c11v18

[1 Corinthians 11:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you. ^c11v19

[1 Corinthians 11:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper. ^c11v20

[1 Corinthians 11:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. ^c11v28

[1 Corinthians 11:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. ^c11v29

[1 Corinthians 11:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. ^c11v30

[1 Corinthians 11:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. ^c11v31

[1 Corinthians 11:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. ^c11v32

[1 Corinthians 11:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. ^c11v33

[1 Corinthians 11:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/11?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. ^c11v34

[1 Corinthians 12:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) NOW concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant. ^c12v1

[1 Corinthians 12:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led. ^c12v2

[1 Corinthians 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. ^c12v3

[1 Corinthians 12:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. ^c12v4

[1 Corinthians 12:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. ^c12v5

[1 Corinthians 12:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all. ^c12v6

[1 Corinthians 12:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. ^c12v7

[1 Corinthians 12:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; ^c12v8

[1 Corinthians 12:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit; ^c12v9

[1 Corinthians 12:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: ^c12v10

[1 Corinthians 12:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will. ^c12v11

[1 Corinthians 12:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ. ^c12v12

[1 Corinthians 12:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. ^c12v13

[1 Corinthians 12:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For the body is not one member, but many. ^c12v14

[1 Corinthians 12:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? ^c12v15

[1 Corinthians 12:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? ^c12v16

[1 Corinthians 12:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? ^c12v17

[1 Corinthians 12:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. ^c12v18

[1 Corinthians 12:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And if they were all one member, where were the body? ^c12v19

[1 Corinthians 12:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) But now are they many members, yet but one body. ^c12v20

[1 Corinthians 12:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. ^c12v21

[1 Corinthians 12:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: ^c12v22

[1 Corinthians 12:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. ^c12v23

[1 Corinthians 12:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: ^c12v24

[1 Corinthians 12:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. ^c12v25

[1 Corinthians 12:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. ^c12v26

[1 Corinthians 12:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. ^c12v27

[1 Corinthians 12:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. ^c12v28

[1 Corinthians 12:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? ^c12v29

[1 Corinthians 12:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? ^c12v30

[1 Corinthians 12:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/12?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. ^c12v31

[1 Corinthians 13:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. ^c13v1

[1 Corinthians 13:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. ^c13v2

[1 Corinthians 13:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. ^c13v3

[1 Corinthians 13:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, ^c13v4

[1 Corinthians 13:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil; ^c13v5

[1 Corinthians 13:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; ^c13v6

[1 Corinthians 13:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things. ^c13v7

[1 Corinthians 13:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. ^c13v8

[1 Corinthians 13:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. ^c13v9

[1 Corinthians 13:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. ^c13v10

[1 Corinthians 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. ^c13v11

[1 Corinthians 13:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. ^c13v12

[1 Corinthians 13:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/13?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity. ^c13v13

[1 Corinthians 14:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) FOLLOW after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy. ^c14v1

[1 Corinthians 14:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. ^c14v2

[1 Corinthians 14:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort. ^c14v3

[1 Corinthians 14:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church. ^c14v4

[1 Corinthians 14:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. ^c14v5

[1 Corinthians 14:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine? ^c14v6

[1 Corinthians 14:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? ^c14v7

[1 Corinthians 14:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? ^c14v8

[1 Corinthians 14:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. ^c14v9

[1 Corinthians 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. ^c14v10

[1 Corinthians 14:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me. ^c14v11

[1 Corinthians 14:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. ^c14v12

[1 Corinthians 14:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret. ^c14v13

[1 Corinthians 14:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. ^c14v14

[1 Corinthians 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also. ^c14v15

[1 Corinthians 14:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest? ^c14v16

[1 Corinthians 14:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. ^c14v17

[1 Corinthians 14:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: ^c14v18

[1 Corinthians 14:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue. ^c14v19

[1 Corinthians 14:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. ^c14v20

[1 Corinthians 14:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord. ^c14v21

[1 Corinthians 14:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe. ^c14v22

[1 Corinthians 14:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? ^c14v23

[1 Corinthians 14:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: ^c14v24

[1 Corinthians 14:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth. ^c14v25

[1 Corinthians 14:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. ^c14v26

[1 Corinthians 14:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. ^c14v27

[1 Corinthians 14:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God. ^c14v28

[1 Corinthians 14:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. ^c14v29

[1 Corinthians 14:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace. ^c14v30

[1 Corinthians 14:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. ^c14v31

[1 Corinthians 14:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. ^c14v32

[1 Corinthians 14:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. ^c14v33

[1 Corinthians 14:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law. ^c14v34

[1 Corinthians 14:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. ^c14v35

[1 Corinthians 14:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? ^c14v36

[1 Corinthians 14:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord. ^c14v37

[1 Corinthians 14:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. ^c14v38

[1 Corinthians 14:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues. ^c14v39

[1 Corinthians 14:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/14?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) Let all things be done decently and in order. ^c14v40

[1 Corinthians 15:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) MOREOVER, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; ^c15v1

[1 Corinthians 15:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. ^c15v2

[1 Corinthians 15:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; ^c15v3

[1 Corinthians 15:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: ^c15v4

[1 Corinthians 15:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: ^c15v5

[1 Corinthians 15:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. ^c15v6

[1 Corinthians 15:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. ^c15v7

[1 Corinthians 15:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. ^c15v8

[1 Corinthians 15:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. ^c15v9

[1 Corinthians 15:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. ^c15v10

[1 Corinthians 15:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. ^c15v11

[1 Corinthians 15:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? ^c15v12

[1 Corinthians 15:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: ^c15v13

[1 Corinthians 15:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. ^c15v14

[1 Corinthians 15:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. ^c15v15

[1 Corinthians 15:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: ^c15v16

[1 Corinthians 15:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. ^c15v17

[1 Corinthians 15:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. ^c15v18

[1 Corinthians 15:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable. ^c15v19

[1 Corinthians 15:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. ^c15v20

[1 Corinthians 15:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. ^c15v21

[1 Corinthians 15:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. ^c15v22

[1 Corinthians 15:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. ^c15v23

[1 Corinthians 15:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. ^c15v24

[1 Corinthians 15:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. ^c15v25

[1 Corinthians 15:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. ^c15v26

[1 Corinthians 15:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him. ^c15v27

[1 Corinthians 15:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. ^c15v28

[1 Corinthians 15:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? ^c15v29

[1 Corinthians 15:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? ^c15v30

[1 Corinthians 15:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. ^c15v31

[1 Corinthians 15:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. ^c15v32

[1 Corinthians 15:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. ^c15v33

[1 Corinthians 15:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame. ^c15v34

[1 Corinthians 15:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come? ^c15v35

[1 Corinthians 15:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: ^c15v36

[1 Corinthians 15:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: ^c15v37

[1 Corinthians 15:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body. ^c15v38

[1 Corinthians 15:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. ^c15v39
