[Joseph Smith--History 1:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had done before.
