[Joseph Smith--History 1:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) He also quoted the next verse differently: And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.
