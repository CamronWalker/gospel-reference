[Joseph Smith--History 1:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when "they who would not hear his voice should be cut off from among the people," but soon would come.
