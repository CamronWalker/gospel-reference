[Joseph Smith--History 1:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) He also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated that the fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned here.
