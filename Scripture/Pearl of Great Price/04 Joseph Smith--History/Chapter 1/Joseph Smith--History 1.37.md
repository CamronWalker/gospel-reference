[Joseph Smith--History 1:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
