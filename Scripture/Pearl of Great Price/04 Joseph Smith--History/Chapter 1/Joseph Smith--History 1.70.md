[Joseph Smith--History 1:70](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p70#p70) He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.
