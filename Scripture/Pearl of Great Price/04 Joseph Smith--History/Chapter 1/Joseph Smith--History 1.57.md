[Joseph Smith--History 1:57](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p57#p57) During the time that I was thus employed, I was put to board with a Mr. Isaac Hale, of that place; it was there I first saw my wife (his daughter), Emma Hale. On the 18th of January, 1827, we were married, while I was yet employed in the service of Mr. Stoal.
