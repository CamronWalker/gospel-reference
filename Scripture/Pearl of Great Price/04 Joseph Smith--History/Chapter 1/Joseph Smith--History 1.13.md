[Joseph Smith--History 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to "ask of God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.
