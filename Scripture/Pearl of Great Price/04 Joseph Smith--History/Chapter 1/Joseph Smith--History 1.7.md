[Joseph Smith--History 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother, Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia.
