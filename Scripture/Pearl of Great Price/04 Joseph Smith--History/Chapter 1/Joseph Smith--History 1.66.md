[Joseph Smith--History 1:66](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p66#p66) On the 5th day of April, 1829, Oliver Cowdery came to my house, until which time I had never seen him. He stated to me that having been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided, and my father being one of those who sent to the school, he went to board for a season at his house, and while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received the plates, and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me.
