[Joseph Smith--History 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong)--and which I should join.
