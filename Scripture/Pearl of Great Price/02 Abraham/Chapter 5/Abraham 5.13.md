[Abraham 5:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/5?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the time that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now I, Abraham, saw that it was after the Lord's time, which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning.
