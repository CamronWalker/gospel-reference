[Abraham 5:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/5?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air, and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them; and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.
