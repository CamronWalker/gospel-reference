[Abraham 5:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time, because that on the seventh time they would rest from all their works which they (the Gods) counseled among themselves to form; and sanctified it. And thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth.
