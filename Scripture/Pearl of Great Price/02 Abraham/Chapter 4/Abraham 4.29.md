[Abraham 4:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And the Gods said: Behold, we will give them every herb bearing seed that shall come upon the face of all the earth, and every tree which shall have fruit upon it; yea, the fruit of the tree yielding seed to them we will give it; it shall be for their meat.
