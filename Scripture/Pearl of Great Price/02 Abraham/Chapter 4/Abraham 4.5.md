[Abraham 4:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And the Gods called the light Day, and the darkness they called Night. And it came to pass that from the evening until morning they called night; and from the morning until the evening they called day; and this was the first, or the beginning, of that which they called day and night.
