[Abraham 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the earth, after it was formed, was empty and desolate, because they had not formed anything but the earth; and darkness reigned upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of the Gods was brooding upon the face of the waters.
