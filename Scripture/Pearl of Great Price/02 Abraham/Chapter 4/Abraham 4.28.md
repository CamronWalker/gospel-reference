[Abraham 4:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And the Gods said: We will bless them. And the Gods said: We will cause them to be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.
