[Abraham 4:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the Gods said: Let us prepare the earth to bring forth grass; the herb yielding seed; the fruit tree yielding fruit, after his kind, whose seed in itself yieldeth its own likeness upon the earth; and it was so, even as they ordered.
