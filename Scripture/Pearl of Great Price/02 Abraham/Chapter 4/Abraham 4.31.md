[Abraham 4:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And the Gods said: We will do everything that we have said, and organize them; and behold, they shall be very obedient. And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and they numbered the sixth time.
