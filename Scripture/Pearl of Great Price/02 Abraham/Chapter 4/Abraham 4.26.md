[Abraham 4:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And the Gods took counsel among themselves and said: Let us go down and form man in our image, after our likeness; and we will give them dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
