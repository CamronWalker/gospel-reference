[Abraham 4:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And the Gods prepared the waters that they might bring forth great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters were to bring forth abundantly after their kind; and every winged fowl after their kind. And the Gods saw that they would be obeyed, and that their plan was good.
