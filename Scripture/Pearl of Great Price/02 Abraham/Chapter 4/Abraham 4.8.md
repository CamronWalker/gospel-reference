[Abraham 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And the Gods called the expanse, Heaven. And it came to pass that it was from evening until morning that they called night; and it came to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and this was the second time that they called night and day.
