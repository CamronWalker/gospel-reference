[Abraham 4:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the Gods organized the earth to bring forth grass from its own seed, and the herb to bring forth herb from its own seed, yielding seed after his kind; and the earth to bring forth the tree from its own seed, yielding fruit, whose seed could only bring forth the same in itself, after his kind; and the Gods saw that they were obeyed.
