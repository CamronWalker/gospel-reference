[Abraham 3:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.
