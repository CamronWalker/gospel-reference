[Abraham 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And he said unto me: This is Shinehah, which is the sun. And he said unto me: Kokob, which is star. And he said unto me: Olea, which is the moon. And he said unto me: Kokaubeam, which signifies stars, or all the great lights, which were in the firmament of heaven.
