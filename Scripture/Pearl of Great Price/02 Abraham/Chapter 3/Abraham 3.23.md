[Abraham 3:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.
