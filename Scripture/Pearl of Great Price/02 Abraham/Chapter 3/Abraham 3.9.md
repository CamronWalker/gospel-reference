[Abraham 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one planet above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord's time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.
