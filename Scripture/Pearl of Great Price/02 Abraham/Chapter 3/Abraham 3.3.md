[Abraham 3:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.
