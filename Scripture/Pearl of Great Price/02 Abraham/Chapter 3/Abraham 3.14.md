[Abraham 3:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it was in the night time when the Lord spake these words unto me: I will multiply thee, and thy seed after thee, like unto these; and if thou canst count the number of sands, so shall be the number of thy seeds.
