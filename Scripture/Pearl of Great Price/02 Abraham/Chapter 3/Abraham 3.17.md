[Abraham 3:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Now, if there be two things, one above the other, and the moon be above the earth, then it may be that a planet or a star may exist above it; and there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.
