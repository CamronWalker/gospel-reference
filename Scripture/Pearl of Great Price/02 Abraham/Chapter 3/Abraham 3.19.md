[Abraham 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all.
