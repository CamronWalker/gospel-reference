[Abraham 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, also, if there be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal.
