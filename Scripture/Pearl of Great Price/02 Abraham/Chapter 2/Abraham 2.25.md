[Abraham 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that I, Abraham, told Sarai, my wife, all that the Lord had said unto me--Therefore say unto them, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of thee.
