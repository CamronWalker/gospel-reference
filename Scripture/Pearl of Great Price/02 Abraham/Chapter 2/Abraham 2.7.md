[Abraham 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in heaven; the earth is my footstool; I stretch my hand over the sea, and it obeys my voice; I cause the wind and the fire to be my chariot; I say to the mountains--Depart hence--and behold, they are taken away by a whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly.
