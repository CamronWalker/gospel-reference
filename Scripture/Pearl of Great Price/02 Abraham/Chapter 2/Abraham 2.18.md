[Abraham 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And then we passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of Sechem; it was situated in the plains of Moreh, and we had already come into the borders of the land of the Canaanites, and I offered sacrifice there in the plains of Moreh, and called on the Lord devoutly, because we had already come into the land of this idolatrous nation.
