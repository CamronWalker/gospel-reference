[Abraham 2:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Therefore I left the land of Ur, of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and I took Lot, my brother's son, and his wife, and Sarai my wife; and also my father followed after me, unto the land which we denominated Haran.
