[Abraham 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And I, Abraham, journeyed, going on still towards the south; and there was a continuation of a famine in the land; and I, Abraham, concluded to go down into Egypt, to sojourn there, for the famine became very grievous.
