[Abraham 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the fathers, from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the foundation of the earth, down to the present time, even the right of the firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam, or first father, through the fathers unto me.
