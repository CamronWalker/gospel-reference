[Abraham 1:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Behold, Potiphar's Hill was in the land of Ur, of Chaldea. And the Lord broke down the altar of Elkenah, and of the gods of the land, and utterly destroyed them, and smote the priest that he died; and there was great mourning in Chaldea, and also in the court of Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies king by royal blood.
