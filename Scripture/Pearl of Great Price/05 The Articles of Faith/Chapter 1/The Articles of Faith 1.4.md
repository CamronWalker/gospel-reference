[The Articles of Faith 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) We believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost.
