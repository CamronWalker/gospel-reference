[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) When you, therefore, shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, then you shall stand in the holy place; whoso readeth let him understand.
