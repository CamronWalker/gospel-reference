[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And Jesus said unto them: See ye not all these things, and do ye not understand them? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left here, upon this temple, one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.
