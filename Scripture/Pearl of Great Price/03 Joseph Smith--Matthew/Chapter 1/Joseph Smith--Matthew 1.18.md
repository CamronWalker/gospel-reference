[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For then, in those days, shall be great tribulation on the Jews, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, such as was not before sent upon Israel, of God, since the beginning of their kingdom until this time; no, nor ever shall be sent again upon Israel.
