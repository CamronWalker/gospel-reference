[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple; and his disciples came to him, for to hear him, saying: Master, show us concerning the buildings of the temple, as thou hast said--They shall be thrown down, and left unto you desolate.
