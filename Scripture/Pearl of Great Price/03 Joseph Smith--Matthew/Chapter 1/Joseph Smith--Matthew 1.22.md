[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) For in those days there shall also arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch, that, if possible, they shall deceive the very elect, who are the elect according to the covenant.
