[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Behold, I speak these things unto you for the elect's sake; and you also shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled, for all I have told you must come to pass; but the end is not yet.
