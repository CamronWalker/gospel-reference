[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived, for the Son of Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the remainder of his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
