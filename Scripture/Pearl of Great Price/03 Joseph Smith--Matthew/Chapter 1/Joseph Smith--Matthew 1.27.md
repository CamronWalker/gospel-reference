[Joseph Smith--Matthew 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-m/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And now I show unto you a parable. Behold, wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together; so likewise shall mine elect be gathered from the four quarters of the earth.
