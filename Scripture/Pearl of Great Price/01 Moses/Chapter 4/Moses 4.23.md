[Moses 4:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And unto Adam, I, the Lord God, said: Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the fruit of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying--Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed shall be the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
