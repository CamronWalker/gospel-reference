[Moses 4:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Unto the woman, I, the Lord God, said: I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception. In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children, and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
