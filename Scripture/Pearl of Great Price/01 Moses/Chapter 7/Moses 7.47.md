[Moses 7:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) And behold, Enoch saw the day of the coming of the Son of Man, even in the flesh; and his soul rejoiced, saying: The Righteous is lifted up, and the Lamb is slain from the foundation of the world; and through faith I am in the bosom of the Father, and behold, Zion is with me.
