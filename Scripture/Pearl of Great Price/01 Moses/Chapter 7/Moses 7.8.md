[Moses 7:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For behold, the Lord shall curse the land with much heat, and the barrenness thereof shall go forth forever; and there was a blackness came upon all the children of Canaan, that they were despised among all people.
