[Moses 7:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass that Enoch talked with the Lord; and he said unto the Lord: Surely Zion shall dwell in safety forever. But the Lord said unto Enoch: Zion have I blessed, but the residue of the people have I cursed.
