[Moses 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass that the Lord showed unto Enoch all the inhabitants of the earth; and he beheld, and lo, Zion, in process of time, was taken up into heaven. And the Lord said unto Enoch: Behold mine abode forever.
