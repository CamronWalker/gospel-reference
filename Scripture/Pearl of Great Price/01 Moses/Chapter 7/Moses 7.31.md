[Moses 7:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And thou hast taken Zion to thine own bosom, from all thy creations, from all eternity to all eternity; and naught but peace, justice, and truth is the habitation of thy throne; and mercy shall go before thy face and have no end; how is it thou canst weep?
