[Moses 7:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Wherefore, I can stretch forth mine hands and hold all the creations which I have made; and mine eye can pierce them also, and among all the workmanship of mine hands there has not been so great wickedness as among thy brethren.
