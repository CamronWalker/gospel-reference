[Moses 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) There also came up a land out of the depth of the sea, and so great was the fear of the enemies of the people of God, that they fled and stood afar off and went upon the land which came up out of the depth of the sea.
