[Moses 7:69](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p69#p69) And Enoch and all his people walked with God, and he dwelt in the midst of Zion; and it came to pass that Zion was not, for God received it up into his own bosom; and from thence went forth the saying, ZION IS FLED.
