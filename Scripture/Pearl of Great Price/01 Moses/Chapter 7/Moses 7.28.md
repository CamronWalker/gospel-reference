[Moses 7:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And it came to pass that the God of heaven looked upon the residue of the people, and he wept; and Enoch bore record of it, saying: How is it that the heavens weep, and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains?
