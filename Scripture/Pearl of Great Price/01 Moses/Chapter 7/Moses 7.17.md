[Moses 7:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) The fear of the Lord was upon all nations, so great was the glory of the Lord, which was upon his people. And the Lord blessed the land, and they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and did flourish.
