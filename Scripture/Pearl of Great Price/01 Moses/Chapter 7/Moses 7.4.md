[Moses 7:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And I saw the Lord; and he stood before my face, and he talked with me, even as a man talketh one with another, face to face; and he said unto me: Look, and I will show unto thee the world for the space of many generations.
