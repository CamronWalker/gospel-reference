[Moses 7:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) And it came to pass that Enoch looked; and from Noah, he beheld all the families of the earth; and he cried unto the Lord, saying: When shall the day of the Lord come? When shall the blood of the Righteous be shed, that all they that mourn may be sanctified and have eternal life?
