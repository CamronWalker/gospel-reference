[Moses 7:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) And it came to pass that Enoch continued his cry unto the Lord, saying: I ask thee, O Lord, in the name of thine Only Begotten, even Jesus Christ, that thou wilt have mercy upon Noah and his seed, that the earth might never more be covered by the floods.
