[Moses 7:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) But behold, their sins shall be upon the heads of their fathers; Satan shall be their father, and misery shall be their doom; and the whole heavens shall weep over them, even all the workmanship of mine hands; wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?
