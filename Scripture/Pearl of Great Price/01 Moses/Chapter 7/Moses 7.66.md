[Moses 7:66](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7?lang=eng&id=p66#p66) But before that day he saw great tribulations among the wicked; and he also saw the sea, that it was troubled, and men's hearts failing them, looking forth with fear for the judgments of the Almighty God, which should come upon the wicked.
