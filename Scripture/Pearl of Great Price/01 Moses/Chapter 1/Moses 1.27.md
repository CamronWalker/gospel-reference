[Moses 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes and beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, discerning it by the spirit of God.
