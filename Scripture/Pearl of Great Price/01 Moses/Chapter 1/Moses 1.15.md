[Moses 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Blessed be the name of my God, for his Spirit hath not altogether withdrawn from me, or else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me: Worship God, for him only shalt thou serve.
