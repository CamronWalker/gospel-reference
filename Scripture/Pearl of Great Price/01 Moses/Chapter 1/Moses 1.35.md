[Moses 1:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.
