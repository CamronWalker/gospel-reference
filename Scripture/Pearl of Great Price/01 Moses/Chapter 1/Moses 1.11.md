[Moses 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him.
