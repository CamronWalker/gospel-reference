[Moses 1:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And calling upon the name of God, he beheld his glory again, for it was upon him; and he heard a voice, saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God.
