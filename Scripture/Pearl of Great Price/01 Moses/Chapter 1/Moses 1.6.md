[Moses 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all.
