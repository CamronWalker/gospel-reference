[Moses 1:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, he received strength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory.
