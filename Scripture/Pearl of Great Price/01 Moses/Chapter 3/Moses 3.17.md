[Moses 3:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/3?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
