[Moses 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.
