[Moses 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life, and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.
