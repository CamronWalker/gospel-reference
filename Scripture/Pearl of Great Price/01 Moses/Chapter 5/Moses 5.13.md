[Moses 5:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Satan came among them, saying: I am also a son of God; and he commanded them, saying: Believe it not; and they believed it not, and they loved Satan more than God. And men began from that time forth to be carnal, sensual, and devilish.
