[Moses 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And Eve, his wife, heard all these things and was glad, saying: Were it not for our transgression we never should have had seed, and never should have known good and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God giveth unto all the obedient.
