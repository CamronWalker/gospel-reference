[Moses 5:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it shall be said in time to come--That these abominations were had from Cain; for he rejected the greater counsel which was had from God; and this is a cursing which I will put upon thee, except thou repent.
