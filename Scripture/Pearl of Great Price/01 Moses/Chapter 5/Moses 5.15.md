[Moses 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And as many as believed in the Son, and repented of their sins, should be saved; and as many as believed not and repented not, should be damned; and the words went forth out of the mouth of God in a firm decree; wherefore they must be fulfilled.
