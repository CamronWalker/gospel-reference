[Moses 5:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And Adam and Eve, his wife, called upon the name of the Lord, and they heard the voice of the Lord from the way toward the Garden of Eden, speaking unto them, and they saw him not; for they were shut out from his presence.
