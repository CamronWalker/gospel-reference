[Moses 5:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) Wherefore the Lord cursed Lamech, and his house, and all them that had covenanted with Satan; for they kept not the commandments of God, and it displeased God, and he ministered not unto them, and their works were abominations, and began to spread among all the sons of men. And it was among the sons of men.
