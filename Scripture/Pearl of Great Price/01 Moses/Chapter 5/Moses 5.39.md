[Moses 5:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the Lord, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that he that findeth me will slay me, because of mine iniquities, for these things are not hid from the Lord.
