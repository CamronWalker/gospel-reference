[Moses 5:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And in that day Adam blessed God and was filled, and began to prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God.
