[Moses 5:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And Satan said unto Cain: Swear unto me by thy throat, and if thou tell it thou shalt die; and swear thy brethren by their heads, and by the living God, that they tell it not; for if they tell it, they shall surely die; and this that thy father may not know it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine hands.
