[Moses 5:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And in that day the Holy Ghost fell upon Adam, which beareth record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the Only Begotten of the Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast fallen thou mayest be redeemed, and all mankind, even as many as will.
