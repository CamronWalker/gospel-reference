[Moses 5:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And Adam and Eve, his wife, ceased not to call upon God. And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare Cain, and said: I have gotten a man from the Lord; wherefore he may not reject his words. But behold, Cain hearkened not, saying: Who is the Lord that I should know him?
