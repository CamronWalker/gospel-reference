[Moses 6:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And this is a decree, which I have sent forth in the beginning of the world, from my own mouth, from the foundation thereof, and by the mouths of my servants, thy fathers, have I decreed it, even as it shall be sent forth in the world, unto the ends thereof.
