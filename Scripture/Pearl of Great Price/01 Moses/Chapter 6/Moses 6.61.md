[Moses 6:61](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p61#p61) Therefore it is given to abide in you; the record of heaven; the Comforter; the peaceable things of immortal glory; the truth of all things; that which quickeneth all things, which maketh alive all things; that which knoweth all things, and hath all power according to wisdom, mercy, truth, justice, and judgment.
