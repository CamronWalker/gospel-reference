[Moses 6:64](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p64#p64) And it came to pass, when the Lord had spoken with Adam, our father, that Adam cried unto the Lord, and he was caught away by the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried down into the water, and was laid under the water, and was brought forth out of the water.
