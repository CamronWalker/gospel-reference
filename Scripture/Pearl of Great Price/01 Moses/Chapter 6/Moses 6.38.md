[Moses 6:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And they came forth to hear him, upon the high places, saying unto the tent-keepers: Tarry ye here and keep the tents, while we go yonder to behold the seer, for he prophesieth, and there is a strange thing in the land; a wild man hath come among us.
