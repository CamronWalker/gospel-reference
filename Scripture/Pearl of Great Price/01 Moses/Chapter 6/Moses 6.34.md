[Moses 6:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) Behold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me.
