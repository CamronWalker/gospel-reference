[Moses 6:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And it came to pass, as I journeyed from the land of Cainan, by the sea east, I beheld a vision; and lo, the heavens I saw, and the Lord spake with me, and gave me commandment; wherefore, for this cause, to keep the commandment, I speak forth these words.
