[Moses 6:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And for these many generations, ever since the day that I created them, have they gone astray, and have denied me, and have sought their own counsels in the dark; and in their own abominations have they devised murder, and have not kept the commandments, which I gave unto their father, Adam.
