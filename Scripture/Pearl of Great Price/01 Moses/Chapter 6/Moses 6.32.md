[Moses 6:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance, for all flesh is in my hands, and I will do as seemeth me good.
