[Moses 6:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And the children of men were numerous upon all the face of the land. And in those days Satan had great dominion among men, and raged in their hearts; and from thenceforth came wars and bloodshed; and a man's hand was against his own brother, in administering death, because of secret works, seeking for power.
