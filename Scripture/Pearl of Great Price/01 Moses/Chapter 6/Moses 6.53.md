[Moses 6:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) And our father Adam spake unto the Lord, and said: Why is it that men must repent and be baptized in water? And the Lord said unto Adam: Behold I have forgiven thee thy transgression in the Garden of Eden.
