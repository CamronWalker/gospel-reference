[Moses 2:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven, and this earth; write the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest.
