[Moses 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And I, God, made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the greater light was the sun, and the lesser light was the moon; and the stars also were made even according to my word.
