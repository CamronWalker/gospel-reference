[Moses 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And I, God, created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and I, God, saw that all things which I had created were good.
