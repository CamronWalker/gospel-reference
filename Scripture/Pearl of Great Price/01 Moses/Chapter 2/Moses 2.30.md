[Moses 2:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein I grant life, there shall be given every clean herb for meat; and it was so, even as I spake.
