[Moses 8:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Believe and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even as our fathers, and ye shall receive the Holy Ghost, that ye may have all things made manifest; and if ye do not this, the floods will come in upon you; nevertheless they hearkened not.
