[Moses 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And the Lord said unto Noah: My Spirit shall not always strive with man, for he shall know that all flesh shall die; yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years; and if men do not repent, I will send in the floods upon them.
