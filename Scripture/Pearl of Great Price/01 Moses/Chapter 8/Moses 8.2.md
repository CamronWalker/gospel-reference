[Moses 8:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/8?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that Methuselah, the son of Enoch, was not taken, that the covenants of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made to Enoch; for he truly covenanted with Enoch that Noah should be of the fruit of his loins.
