[Ezekiel 28:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/28?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
