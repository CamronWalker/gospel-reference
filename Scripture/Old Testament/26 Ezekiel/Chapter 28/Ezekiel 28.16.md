[Ezekiel 28:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/28?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.
