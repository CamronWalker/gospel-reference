[Ezekiel 28:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/28?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee.
