[Ezekiel 28:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/28?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And they shall dwell safely therein, and shall build houses, and plant vineyards; yea, they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them; and they shall know that I am the LORD their God.
