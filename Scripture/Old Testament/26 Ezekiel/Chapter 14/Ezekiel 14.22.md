[Ezekiel 14:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/14?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Â¶ Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.
