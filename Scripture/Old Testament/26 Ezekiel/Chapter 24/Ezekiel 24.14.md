[Ezekiel 24:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/24?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith the Lord GOD.
