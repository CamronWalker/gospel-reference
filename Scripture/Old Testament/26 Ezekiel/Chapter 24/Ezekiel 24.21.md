[Ezekiel 24:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/24?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
