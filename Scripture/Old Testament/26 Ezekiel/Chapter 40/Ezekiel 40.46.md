[Ezekiel 40:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/40?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the LORD to minister unto him.
