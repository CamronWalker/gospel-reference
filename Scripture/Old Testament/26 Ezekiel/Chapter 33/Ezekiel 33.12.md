[Ezekiel 33:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore, thou son of man, say unto the children of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression: as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness; neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth.
