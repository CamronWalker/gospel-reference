[Ezekiel 33:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
