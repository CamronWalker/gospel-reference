[Ezekiel 33:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) When I shall say to the righteous, that he shall surely live; if he trust to his own righteousness, and commit iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he hath committed, he shall die for it.
