[Ezekiel 33:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
