[Ezekiel 33:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/33?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And they come unto thee as the people cometh, and they sit before thee as my people, and they hear thy words, but they will not do them: for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetousness.
