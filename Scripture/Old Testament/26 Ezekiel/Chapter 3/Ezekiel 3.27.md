[Ezekiel 3:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/3?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
