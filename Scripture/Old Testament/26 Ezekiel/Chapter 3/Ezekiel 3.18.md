[Ezekiel 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.
