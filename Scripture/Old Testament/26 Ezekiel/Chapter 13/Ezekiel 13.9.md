[Ezekiel 13:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/13?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
