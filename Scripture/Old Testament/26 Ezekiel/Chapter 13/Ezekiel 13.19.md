[Ezekiel 13:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/13?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?
