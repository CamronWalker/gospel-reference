[Ezekiel 38:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/38?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.
