[Ezekiel 38:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/38?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Â¶ After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.
