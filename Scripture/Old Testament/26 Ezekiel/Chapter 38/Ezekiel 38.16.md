[Ezekiel 38:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/38?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
