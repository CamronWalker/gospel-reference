[Ezekiel 23:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/23?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.
