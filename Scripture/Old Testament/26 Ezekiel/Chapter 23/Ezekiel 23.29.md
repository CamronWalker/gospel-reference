[Ezekiel 23:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/23?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And they shall deal with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
