[Ezekiel 32:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/32?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
