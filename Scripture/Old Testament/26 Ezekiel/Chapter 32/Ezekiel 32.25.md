[Ezekiel 32:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/32?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.
