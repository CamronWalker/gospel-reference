[Ezekiel 32:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/32?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
