[Ezekiel 16:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst prosper into a kingdom.
