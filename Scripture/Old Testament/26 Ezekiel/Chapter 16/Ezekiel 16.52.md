[Ezekiel 16:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
