[Ezekiel 16:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.
