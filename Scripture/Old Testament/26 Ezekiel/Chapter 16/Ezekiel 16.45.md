[Ezekiel 16:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) Thou art thy mother's daughter, that lotheth her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
