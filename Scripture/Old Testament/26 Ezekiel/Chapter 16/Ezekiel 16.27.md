[Ezekiel 16:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of thy lewd way.
