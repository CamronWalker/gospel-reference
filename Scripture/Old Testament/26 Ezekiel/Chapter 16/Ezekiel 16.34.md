[Ezekiel 16:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms, whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art contrary.
