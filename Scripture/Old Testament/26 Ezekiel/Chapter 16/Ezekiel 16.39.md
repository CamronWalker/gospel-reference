[Ezekiel 16:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels, and leave thee naked and bare.
