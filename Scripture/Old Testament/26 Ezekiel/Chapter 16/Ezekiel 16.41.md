[Ezekiel 16:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
