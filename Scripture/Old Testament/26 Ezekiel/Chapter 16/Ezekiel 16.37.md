[Ezekiel 16:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/16?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee, and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
