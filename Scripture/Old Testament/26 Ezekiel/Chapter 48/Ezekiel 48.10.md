[Ezekiel 48:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/48?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall be in the midst thereof.
