[Ezekiel 12:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/12?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
