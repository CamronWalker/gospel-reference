[Ezekiel 12:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/12?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel; but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every vision.
