[Ezekiel 12:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/12?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment, that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein.
