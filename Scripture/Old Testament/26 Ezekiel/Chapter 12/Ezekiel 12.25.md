[Ezekiel 12:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/12?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it, saith the Lord GOD.
