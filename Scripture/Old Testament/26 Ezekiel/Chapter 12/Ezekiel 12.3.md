[Ezekiel 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they be a rebellious house.
