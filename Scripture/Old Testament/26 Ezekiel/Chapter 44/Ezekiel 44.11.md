[Ezekiel 44:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/44?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto them.
