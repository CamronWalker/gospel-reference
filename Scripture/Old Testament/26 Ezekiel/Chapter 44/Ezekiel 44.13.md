[Ezekiel 44:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/44?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations which they have committed.
