[Ezekiel 44:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/44?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.
