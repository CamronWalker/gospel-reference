[Ezekiel 44:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/44?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
