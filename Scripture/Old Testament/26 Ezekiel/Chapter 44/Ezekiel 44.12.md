[Ezekiel 44:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/44?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD and they shall bear their iniquity.
