[Ezekiel 8:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery?  for they say, The LORD seeth us not; the LORD hath forsaken the earth.
