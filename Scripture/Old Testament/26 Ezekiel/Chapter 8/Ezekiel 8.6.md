[Ezekiel 8:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/8?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do?  even the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary?  but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.
