[Ezekiel 37:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/37?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand.
