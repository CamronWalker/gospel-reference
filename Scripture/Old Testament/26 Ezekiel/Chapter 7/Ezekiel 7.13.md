[Ezekiel 7:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/7?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.
