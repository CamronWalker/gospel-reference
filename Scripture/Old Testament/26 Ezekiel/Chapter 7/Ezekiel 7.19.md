[Ezekiel 7:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/7?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity.
