[Ezekiel 18:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/18?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) The soul that sinneth, it shall die.  The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.
