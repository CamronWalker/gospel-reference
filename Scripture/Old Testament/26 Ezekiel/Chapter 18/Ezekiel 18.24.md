[Ezekiel 18:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/18?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Â¶ But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?  All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
