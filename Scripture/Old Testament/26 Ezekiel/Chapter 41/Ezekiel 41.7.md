[Ezekiel 41:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/41?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the midst.
