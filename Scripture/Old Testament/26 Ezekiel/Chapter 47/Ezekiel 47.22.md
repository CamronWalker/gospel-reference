[Ezekiel 47:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/47?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Â¶ And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, which shall beget children among you: and they shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
