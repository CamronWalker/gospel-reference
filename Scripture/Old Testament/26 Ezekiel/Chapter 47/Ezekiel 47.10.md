[Ezekiel 47:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/47?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon it from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim; they shall be a place to spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
