[Ezekiel 20:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.
