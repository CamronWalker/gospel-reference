[Ezekiel 20:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
