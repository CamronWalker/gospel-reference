[Ezekiel 20:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day: and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel?  As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
