[Ezekiel 20:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord GOD; Go ye, serve ye every one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.
