[Ezekiel 20:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet savour, and poured out there their drink offerings.
