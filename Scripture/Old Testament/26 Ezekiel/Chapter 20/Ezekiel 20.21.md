[Ezekiel 20:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
