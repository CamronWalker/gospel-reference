[Ezekiel 20:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) For in mine holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.
