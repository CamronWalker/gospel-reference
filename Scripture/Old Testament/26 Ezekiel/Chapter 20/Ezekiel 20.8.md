[Ezekiel 20:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) But they rebelled against me, and would not hearken unto me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
