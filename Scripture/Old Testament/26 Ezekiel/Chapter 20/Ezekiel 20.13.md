[Ezekiel 20:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.
