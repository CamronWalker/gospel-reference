[Ezekiel 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.
