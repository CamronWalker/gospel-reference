[Ezekiel 43:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/43?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
