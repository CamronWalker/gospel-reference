[Ezekiel 43:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/43?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.
