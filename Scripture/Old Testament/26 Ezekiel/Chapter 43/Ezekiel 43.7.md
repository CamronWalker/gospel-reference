[Ezekiel 43:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/43?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Â¶ And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places.
