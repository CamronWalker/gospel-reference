[Ezekiel 36:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/36?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye went.
