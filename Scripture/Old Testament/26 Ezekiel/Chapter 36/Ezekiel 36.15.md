[Ezekiel 36:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/36?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the Lord GOD.
