[Ezekiel 36:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/36?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates, and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
