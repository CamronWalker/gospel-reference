[Ezekiel 9:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/9?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD hath forsaken the earth, and the LORD seeth not.
