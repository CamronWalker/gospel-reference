[Ezekiel 9:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/9?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary.  Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.
