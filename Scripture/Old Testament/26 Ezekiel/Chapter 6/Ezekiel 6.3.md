[Ezekiel 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
