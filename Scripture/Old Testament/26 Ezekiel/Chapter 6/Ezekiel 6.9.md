[Ezekiel 6:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/6?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which hath departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
