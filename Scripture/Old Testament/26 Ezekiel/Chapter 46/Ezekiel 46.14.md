[Ezekiel 46:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/46?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning, the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.
