[Ezekiel 46:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/46?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession: that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.
