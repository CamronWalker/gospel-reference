[Ezekiel 46:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/46?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
