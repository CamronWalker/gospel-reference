[Ezekiel 22:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/22?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
