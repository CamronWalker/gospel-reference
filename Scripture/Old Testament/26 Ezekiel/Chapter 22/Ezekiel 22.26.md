[Ezekiel 22:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/22?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
