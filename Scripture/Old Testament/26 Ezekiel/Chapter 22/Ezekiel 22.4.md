[Ezekiel 22:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/22?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
