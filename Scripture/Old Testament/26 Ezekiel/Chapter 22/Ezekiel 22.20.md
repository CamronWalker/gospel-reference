[Ezekiel 22:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/22?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
