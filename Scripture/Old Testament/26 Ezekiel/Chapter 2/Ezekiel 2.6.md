[Ezekiel 2:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/2?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Â¶ And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.
