[Ezekiel 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Then said I, Ah Lord GOD!  behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
