[Ezekiel 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it.  This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
