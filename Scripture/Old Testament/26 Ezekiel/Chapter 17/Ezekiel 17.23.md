[Ezekiel 17:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) In the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.
