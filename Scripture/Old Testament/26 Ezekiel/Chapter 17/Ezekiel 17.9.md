[Ezekiel 17:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/17?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Shall it prosper?  shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it wither?  it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring, even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof.
