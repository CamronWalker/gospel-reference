[Ezekiel 29:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/29?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers: thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered: I have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
