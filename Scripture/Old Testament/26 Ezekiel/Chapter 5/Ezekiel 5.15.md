[Ezekiel 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes.  I the LORD have spoken it.
