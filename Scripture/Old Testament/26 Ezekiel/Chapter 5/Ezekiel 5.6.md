[Ezekiel 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.
