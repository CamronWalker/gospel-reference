[Ezekiel 5:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/5?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Thus shall mine anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.
