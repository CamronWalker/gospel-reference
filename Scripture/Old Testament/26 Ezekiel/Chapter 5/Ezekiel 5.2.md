[Ezekiel 5:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/5?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
