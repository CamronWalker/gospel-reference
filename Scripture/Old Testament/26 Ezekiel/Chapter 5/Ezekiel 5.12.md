[Ezekiel 5:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/5?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Â¶ A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
