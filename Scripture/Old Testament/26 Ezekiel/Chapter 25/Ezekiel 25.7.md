[Ezekiel 25:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/25?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
