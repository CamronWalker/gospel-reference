[Ezekiel 25:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/25?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
