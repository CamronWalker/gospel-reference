[Ezekiel 39:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/39?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Â¶ And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
