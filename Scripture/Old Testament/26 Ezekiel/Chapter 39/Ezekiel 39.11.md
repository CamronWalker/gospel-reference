[Ezekiel 39:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/39?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Â¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamon-gog.
