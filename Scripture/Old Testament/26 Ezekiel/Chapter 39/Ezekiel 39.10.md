[Ezekiel 39:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/39?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.
