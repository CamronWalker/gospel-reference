[Ezekiel 45:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/45?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord GOD.
