[Ezekiel 45:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/45?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) MOREOVER, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten thousand.  This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.
