[Ezekiel 45:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/45?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.
