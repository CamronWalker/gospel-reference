[Ezekiel 30:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/30?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt: and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
