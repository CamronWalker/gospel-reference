[Ezekiel 30:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/30?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
