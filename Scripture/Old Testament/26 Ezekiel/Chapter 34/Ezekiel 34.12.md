[Ezekiel 34:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/34?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) As a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered; so will I seek out my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
