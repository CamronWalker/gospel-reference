[Ezekiel 34:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/34?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her increase, and they shall be safe in their land, and shall know that I am the LORD, when I have broken the bands of their yoke, and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them.
