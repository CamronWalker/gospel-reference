[Ezekiel 34:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/34?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment.
