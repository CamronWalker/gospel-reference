[Ezekiel 34:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/34?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures?  and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet?
