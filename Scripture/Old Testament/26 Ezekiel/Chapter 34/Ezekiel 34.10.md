[Ezekiel 34:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/34?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand, and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, that they may not be meat for them.
