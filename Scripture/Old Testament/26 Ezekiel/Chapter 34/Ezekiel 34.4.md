[Ezekiel 34:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/34?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them.
