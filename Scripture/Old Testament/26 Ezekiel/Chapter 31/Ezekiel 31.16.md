[Ezekiel 31:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/31?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
