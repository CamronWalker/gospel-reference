[Ezekiel 35:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/35?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the LORD.
