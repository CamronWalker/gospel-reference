[Ezekiel 35:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/35?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.
