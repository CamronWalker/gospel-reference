[Ezekiel 21:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/21?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
