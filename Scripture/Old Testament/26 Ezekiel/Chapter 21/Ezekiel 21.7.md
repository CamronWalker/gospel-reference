[Ezekiel 21:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/21?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou?  that thou shalt answer, For the tidings; because it cometh: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and shall be brought to pass, saith the Lord GOD.
