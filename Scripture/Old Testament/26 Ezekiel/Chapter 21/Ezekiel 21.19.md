[Ezekiel 21:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/21?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both twain shall come forth out of one land: and choose thou a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.
