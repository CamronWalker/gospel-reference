[Ezekiel 27:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/27?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Thy riches, and thy fairs, thy merchandise, thy mariners, and thy pilots, thy calkers, and the occupiers of thy merchandise, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
