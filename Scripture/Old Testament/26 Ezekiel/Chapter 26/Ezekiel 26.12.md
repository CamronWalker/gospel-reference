[Ezekiel 26:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/26?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And they shall make a spoil of thy riches, and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down thy walls, and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water.
