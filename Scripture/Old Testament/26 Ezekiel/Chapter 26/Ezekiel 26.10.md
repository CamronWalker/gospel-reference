[Ezekiel 26:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/26?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee: thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into thy gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.
