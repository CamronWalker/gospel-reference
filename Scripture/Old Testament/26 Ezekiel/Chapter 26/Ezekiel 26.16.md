[Ezekiel 26:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/26?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at thee.
