[Song of Solomon 5:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/song/5?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) I AM come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
