[Psalm 17:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/17?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
