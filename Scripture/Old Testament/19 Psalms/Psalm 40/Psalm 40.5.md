[Psalm 40:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ps/40?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
