[Joshua 20:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/20?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house, unto the city from whence he fled.
