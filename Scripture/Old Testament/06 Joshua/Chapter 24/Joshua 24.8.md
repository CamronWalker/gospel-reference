[Joshua 24:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/24?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
