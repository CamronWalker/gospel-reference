[Joshua 24:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/24?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.
