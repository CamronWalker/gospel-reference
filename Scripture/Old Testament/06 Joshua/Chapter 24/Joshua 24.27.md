[Joshua 24:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/24?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.
