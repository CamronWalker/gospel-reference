[Joshua 24:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/24?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.
