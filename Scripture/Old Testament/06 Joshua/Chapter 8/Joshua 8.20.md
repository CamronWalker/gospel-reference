[Joshua 8:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.
