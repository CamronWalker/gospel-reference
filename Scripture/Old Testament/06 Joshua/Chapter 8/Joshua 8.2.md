[Joshua 8:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/8?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
