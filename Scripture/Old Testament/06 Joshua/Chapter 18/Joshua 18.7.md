[Joshua 18:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/18?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.
