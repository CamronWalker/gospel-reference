[Joshua 18:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/18?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Beth-horon southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjath-baal, which is Kirjath-jearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.
