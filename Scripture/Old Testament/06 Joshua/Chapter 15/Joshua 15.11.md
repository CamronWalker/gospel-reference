[Joshua 15:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/15?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.
