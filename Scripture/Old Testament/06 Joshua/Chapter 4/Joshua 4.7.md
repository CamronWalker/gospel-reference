[Joshua 4:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/4?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
