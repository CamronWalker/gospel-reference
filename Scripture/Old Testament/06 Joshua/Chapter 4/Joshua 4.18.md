[Joshua 4:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/4?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as they did before.
