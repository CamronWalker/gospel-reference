[Joshua 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.
