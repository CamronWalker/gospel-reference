[Joshua 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.
