[Joshua 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon him.
