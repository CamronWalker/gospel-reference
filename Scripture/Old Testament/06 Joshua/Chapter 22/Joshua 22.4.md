[Joshua 22:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/22?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.
