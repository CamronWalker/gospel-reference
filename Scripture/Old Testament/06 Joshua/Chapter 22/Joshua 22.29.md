[Joshua 22:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/22?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.
