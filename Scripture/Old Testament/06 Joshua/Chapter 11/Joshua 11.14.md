[Joshua 11:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/11?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.
