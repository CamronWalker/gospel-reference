[Joshua 11:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/11?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.
