[Joshua 6:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.
