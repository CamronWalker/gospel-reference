[Joshua 6:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/6?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
