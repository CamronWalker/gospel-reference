[Joshua 6:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/6?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) ¶ And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.
