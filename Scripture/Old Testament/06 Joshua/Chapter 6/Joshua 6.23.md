[Joshua 6:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/6?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.
