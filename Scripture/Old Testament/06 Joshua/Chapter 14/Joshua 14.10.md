[Joshua 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
