[Joshua 14:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/14?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.
