[Joshua 17:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/17?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and though they be strong.
