[Joshua 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.
