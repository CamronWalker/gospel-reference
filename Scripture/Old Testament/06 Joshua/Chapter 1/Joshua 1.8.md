[Joshua 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
