[Joshua 23:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/23?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and not one thing hath failed thereof.
