[Joshua 23:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/23?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
