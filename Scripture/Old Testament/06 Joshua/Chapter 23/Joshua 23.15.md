[Joshua 23:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/23?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God hath given you.
