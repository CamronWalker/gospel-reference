[Joshua 13:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/13?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
