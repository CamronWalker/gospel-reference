[Joshua 10:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.
