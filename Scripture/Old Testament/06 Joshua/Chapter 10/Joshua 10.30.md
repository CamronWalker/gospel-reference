[Joshua 10:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.
