[Joshua 10:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the LORD cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.
