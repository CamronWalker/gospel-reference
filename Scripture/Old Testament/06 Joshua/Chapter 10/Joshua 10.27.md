[Joshua 10:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this very day.
