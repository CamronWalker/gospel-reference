[Joshua 10:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Â¶ And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
