[Joshua 10:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities.
