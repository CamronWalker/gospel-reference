[Joshua 10:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/10?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were therein.
