[Joshua 21:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/21?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their enemies into their hand.
