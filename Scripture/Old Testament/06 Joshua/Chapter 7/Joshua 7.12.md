[Joshua 7:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/7?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.
