[Joshua 7:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/7?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put it even among their own stuff.
