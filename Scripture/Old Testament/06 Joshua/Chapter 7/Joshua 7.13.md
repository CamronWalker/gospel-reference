[Joshua 7:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/7?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.
