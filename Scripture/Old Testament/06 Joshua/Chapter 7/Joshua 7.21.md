[Joshua 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
