[Joshua 7:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/josh/7?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.
