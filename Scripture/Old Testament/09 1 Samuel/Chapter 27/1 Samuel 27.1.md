[1 Samuel 27:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/27?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.
