[1 Samuel 28:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/28?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Â¶ And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?  And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.
