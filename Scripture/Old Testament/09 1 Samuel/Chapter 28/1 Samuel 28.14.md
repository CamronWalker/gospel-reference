[1 Samuel 28:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/28?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And he said unto her, What form is he of?  And she said, An old man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle.  And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.
