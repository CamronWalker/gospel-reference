[1 Samuel 28:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/28?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
