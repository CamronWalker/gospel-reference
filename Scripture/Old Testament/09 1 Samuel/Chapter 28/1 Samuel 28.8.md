[1 Samuel 28:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/28?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.
