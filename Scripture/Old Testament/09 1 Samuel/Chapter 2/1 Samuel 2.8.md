[1 Samuel 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.
