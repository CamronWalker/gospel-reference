[1 Samuel 2:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me?  and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
