[1 Samuel 2:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.
