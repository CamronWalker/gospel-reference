[1 Samuel 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.
