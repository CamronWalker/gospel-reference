[1 Samuel 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?  Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.
