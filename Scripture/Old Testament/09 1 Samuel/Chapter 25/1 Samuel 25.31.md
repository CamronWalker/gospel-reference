[1 Samuel 25:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.
