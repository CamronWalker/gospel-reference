[1 Samuel 25:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.  And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.
