[1 Samuel 25:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days.
