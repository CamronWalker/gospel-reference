[1 Samuel 25:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.
