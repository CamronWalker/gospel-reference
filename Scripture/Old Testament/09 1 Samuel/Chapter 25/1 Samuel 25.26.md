[1 Samuel 25:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as Nabal.
