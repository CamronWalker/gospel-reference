[1 Samuel 25:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee.  Wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants, and to thy son David.
