[1 Samuel 25:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Â¶ And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
