[1 Samuel 25:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
