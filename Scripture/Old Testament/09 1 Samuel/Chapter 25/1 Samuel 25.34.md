[1 Samuel 25:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/25?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.
