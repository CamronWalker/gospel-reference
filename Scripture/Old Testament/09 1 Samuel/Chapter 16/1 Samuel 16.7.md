[1 Samuel 16:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.
