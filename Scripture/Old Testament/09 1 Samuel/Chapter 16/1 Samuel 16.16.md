[1 Samuel 16:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee, to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
