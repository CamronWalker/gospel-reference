[1 Samuel 16:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?  fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons.
