[1 Samuel 16:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/16?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children?  And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.
