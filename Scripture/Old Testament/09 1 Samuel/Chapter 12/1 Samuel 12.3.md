[1 Samuel 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken?  or whose ass have I taken?  or whom have I defrauded?  whom have I oppressed?  or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?  and I will restore it you.
