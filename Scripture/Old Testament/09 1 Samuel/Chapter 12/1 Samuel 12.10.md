[1 Samuel 12:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
