[1 Samuel 12:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Is it not wheat harvest to day?  I will call unto the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.
