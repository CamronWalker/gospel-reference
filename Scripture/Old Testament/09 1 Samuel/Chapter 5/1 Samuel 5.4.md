[1 Samuel 5:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/5?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
