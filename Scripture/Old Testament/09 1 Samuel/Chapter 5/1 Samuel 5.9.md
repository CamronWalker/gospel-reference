[1 Samuel 5:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/5?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of the LORD was against the city with a very great destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.
