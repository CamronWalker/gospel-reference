[1 Samuel 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Â¶ And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before the Philistines?  Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies.
