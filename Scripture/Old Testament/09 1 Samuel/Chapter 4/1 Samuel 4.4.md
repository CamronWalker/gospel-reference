[1 Samuel 4:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.
