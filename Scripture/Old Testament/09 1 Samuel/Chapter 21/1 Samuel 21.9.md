[1 Samuel 21:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/21?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it: for there is no other save that here.  And David said, There is none like that; give it me.
