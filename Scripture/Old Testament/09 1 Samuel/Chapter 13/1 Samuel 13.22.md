[1 Samuel 13:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/13?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with Jonathan his son was there found.
