[1 Samuel 26:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/26?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) This thing is not good that thou hast done.  As the LORD liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD's anointed.  And now see where the king's spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
