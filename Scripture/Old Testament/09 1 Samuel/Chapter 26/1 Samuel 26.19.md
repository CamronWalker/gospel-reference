[1 Samuel 26:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/26?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant.  If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.
