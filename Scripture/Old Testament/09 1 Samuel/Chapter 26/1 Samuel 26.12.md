[1 Samuel 26:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/26?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.
