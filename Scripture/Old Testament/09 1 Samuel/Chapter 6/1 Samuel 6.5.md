[1 Samuel 6:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
