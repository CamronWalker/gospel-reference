[1 Samuel 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you.
