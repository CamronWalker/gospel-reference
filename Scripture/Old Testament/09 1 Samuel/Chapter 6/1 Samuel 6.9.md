[1 Samuel 6:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/6?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Beth-shemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us.
