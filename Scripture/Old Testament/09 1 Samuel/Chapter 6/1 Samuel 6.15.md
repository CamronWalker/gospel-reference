[1 Samuel 6:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/6?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the LORD.
