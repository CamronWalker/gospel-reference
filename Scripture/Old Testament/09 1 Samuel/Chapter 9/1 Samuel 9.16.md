[1 Samuel 9:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/9?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me.
