[1 Samuel 9:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/9?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before Saul.  And Samuel said, Behold that which is left!  set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people.  So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
