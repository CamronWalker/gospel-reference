[1 Samuel 9:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/9?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away.  And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
