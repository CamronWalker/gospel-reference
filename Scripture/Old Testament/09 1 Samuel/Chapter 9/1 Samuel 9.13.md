[1 Samuel 9:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/9?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden.  Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.
