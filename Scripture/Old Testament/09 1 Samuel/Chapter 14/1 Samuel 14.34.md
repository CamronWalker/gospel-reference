[1 Samuel 14:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with the blood.  And all the people brought every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.
