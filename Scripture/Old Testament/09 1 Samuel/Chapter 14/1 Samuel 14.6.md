[1 Samuel 14:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.
