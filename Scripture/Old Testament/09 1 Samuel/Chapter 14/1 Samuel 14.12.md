[1 Samuel 14:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing.  And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
