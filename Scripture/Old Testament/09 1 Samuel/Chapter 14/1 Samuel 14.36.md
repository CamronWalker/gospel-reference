[1 Samuel 14:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Â¶ And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night, and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them.  And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee.  Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.
