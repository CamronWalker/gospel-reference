[1 Samuel 14:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) NOW it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other side.  But he told not his father.
