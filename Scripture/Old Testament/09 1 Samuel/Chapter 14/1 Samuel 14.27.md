[1 Samuel 14:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.
