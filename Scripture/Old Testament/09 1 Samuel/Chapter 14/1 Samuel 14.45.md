[1 Samuel 14:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath wrought this great salvation in Israel?  God forbid: as the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath wrought with God this day.  So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died not.
