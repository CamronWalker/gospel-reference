[1 Samuel 22:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/22?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Â¶ And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn, and slay the priests of the LORD; because their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to me.  But the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.
