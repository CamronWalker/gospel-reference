[1 Samuel 22:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/22?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests.  And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod.
