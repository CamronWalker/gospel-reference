[1 Samuel 22:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/22?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
