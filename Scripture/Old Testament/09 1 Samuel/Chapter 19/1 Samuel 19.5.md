[1 Samuel 19:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/19?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
