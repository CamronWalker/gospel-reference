[1 Samuel 30:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/30?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David encouraged himself in the LORD his God.
