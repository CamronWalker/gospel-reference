[1 Samuel 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head.
