[1 Samuel 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines.  And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.
