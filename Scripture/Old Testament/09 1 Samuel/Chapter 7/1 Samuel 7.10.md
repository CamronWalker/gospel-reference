[1 Samuel 7:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/7?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.
