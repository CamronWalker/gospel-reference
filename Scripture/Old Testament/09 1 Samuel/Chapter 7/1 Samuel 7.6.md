[1 Samuel 7:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD.  And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
