[1 Samuel 7:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/7?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Â¶ And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.
