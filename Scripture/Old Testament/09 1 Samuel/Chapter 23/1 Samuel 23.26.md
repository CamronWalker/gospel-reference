[1 Samuel 23:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/23?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
