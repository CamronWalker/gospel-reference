[1 Samuel 23:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/23?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Saul also and his men went to seek him.  And they told David: wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the wilderness of Maon.  And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
