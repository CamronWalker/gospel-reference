[1 Samuel 24:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/24?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee.  Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe privily.
