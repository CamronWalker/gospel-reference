[1 Samuel 24:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/24?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the LORD's anointed.
