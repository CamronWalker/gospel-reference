[1 Samuel 15:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/15?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Â¶ And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.  So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
