[1 Samuel 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us.  Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.
