[1 Samuel 10:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/10?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.
