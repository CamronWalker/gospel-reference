[1 Samuel 11:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/11?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
