[1 Samuel 11:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/11?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabesh-gilead, To morrow, by that time the sun be hot, ye shall have help.  And the messengers came and shewed it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.
