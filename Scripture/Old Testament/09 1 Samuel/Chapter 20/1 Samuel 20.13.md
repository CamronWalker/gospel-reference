[1 Samuel 20:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with thee, as he hath been with my father.
