[1 Samuel 20:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
