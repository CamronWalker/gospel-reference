[1 Samuel 20:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren.  Therefore he cometh not unto the king's table.
