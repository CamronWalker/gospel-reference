[1 Samuel 20:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the arrows.  If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.
