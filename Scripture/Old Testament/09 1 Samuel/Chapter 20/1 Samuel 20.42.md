[1 Samuel 20:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for ever.  And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the city.
