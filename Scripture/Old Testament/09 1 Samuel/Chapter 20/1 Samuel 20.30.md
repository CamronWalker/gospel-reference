[1 Samuel 20:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?
