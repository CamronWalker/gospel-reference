[1 Samuel 31:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/31?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and abuse me.  But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.  Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
