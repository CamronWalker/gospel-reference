[1 Samuel 17:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array?  am not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul?  choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.
