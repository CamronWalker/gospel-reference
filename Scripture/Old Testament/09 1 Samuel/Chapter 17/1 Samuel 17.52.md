[1 Samuel 17:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron.  And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.
