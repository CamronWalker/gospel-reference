[1 Samuel 17:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come up?  surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's house free in Israel.
