[1 Samuel 17:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
