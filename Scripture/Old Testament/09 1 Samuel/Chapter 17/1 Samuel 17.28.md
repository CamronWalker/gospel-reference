[1 Samuel 17:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) ¶ And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why camest thou down hither?  and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness?  I know thy pride, and the naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle.
