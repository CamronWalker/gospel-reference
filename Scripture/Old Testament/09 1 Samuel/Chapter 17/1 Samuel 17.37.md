[1 Samuel 17:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine.  And Saul said unto David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.
