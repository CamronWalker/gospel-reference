[Micah 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.
