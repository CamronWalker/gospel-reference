[Micah 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Â¶ I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
