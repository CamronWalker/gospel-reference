[Micah 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us?  none evil can come upon us.
