[Micah 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Â¶ And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
