[Micah 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
