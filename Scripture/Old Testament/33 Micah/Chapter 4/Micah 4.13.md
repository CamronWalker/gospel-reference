[Micah 4:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.
