[Micah 6:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/6?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Â¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
