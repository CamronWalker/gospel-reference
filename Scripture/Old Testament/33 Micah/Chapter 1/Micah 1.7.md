[Micah 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.
