[2 Samuel 12:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on David's head.  And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
