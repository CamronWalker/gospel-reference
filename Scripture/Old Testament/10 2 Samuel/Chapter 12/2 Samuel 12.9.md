[2 Samuel 12:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do evil in his sight?  thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
