[2 Samuel 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.
