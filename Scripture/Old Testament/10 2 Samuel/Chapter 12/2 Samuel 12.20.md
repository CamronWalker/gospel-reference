[2 Samuel 12:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.
