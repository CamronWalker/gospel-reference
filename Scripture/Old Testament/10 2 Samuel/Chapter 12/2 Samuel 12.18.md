[2 Samuel 12:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/12?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.  And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the child is dead?
