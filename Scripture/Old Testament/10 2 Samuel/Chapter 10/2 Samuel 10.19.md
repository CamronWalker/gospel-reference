[2 Samuel 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel, and served them.  So the Syrians feared to help the children of Ammon any more.
