[2 Samuel 10:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/10?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me.  And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father.  And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.
