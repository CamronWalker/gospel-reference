[2 Samuel 5:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/5?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the Philistines.
