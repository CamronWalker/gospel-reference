[2 Samuel 5:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.  Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
