[2 Samuel 5:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/5?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the breach of waters.  Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
