[2 Samuel 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines?  wilt thou deliver them into mine hand?  And the LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand.
