[2 Samuel 19:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/19?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.
