[2 Samuel 19:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/19?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table.  What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
