[2 Samuel 19:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/19?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now.
