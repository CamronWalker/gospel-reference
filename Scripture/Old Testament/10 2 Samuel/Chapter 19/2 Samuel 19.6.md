[2 Samuel 19:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/19?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends.  For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well.
