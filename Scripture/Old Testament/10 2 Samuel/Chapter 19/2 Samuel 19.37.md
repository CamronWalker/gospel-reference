[2 Samuel 19:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/19?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother.  But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
