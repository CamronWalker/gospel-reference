[2 Samuel 15:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/15?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices.  And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.
