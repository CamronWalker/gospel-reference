[2 Samuel 15:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/15?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And David said unto all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
