[2 Samuel 15:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/15?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.
