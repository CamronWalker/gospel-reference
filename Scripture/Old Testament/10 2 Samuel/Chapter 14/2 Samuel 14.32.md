[2 Samuel 14:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying, Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur?  it had been good for me to have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
