[2 Samuel 14:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not expelled from him.
