[2 Samuel 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid: and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.
