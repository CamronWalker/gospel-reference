[2 Samuel 14:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.
