[2 Samuel 14:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my son.  And he said, As the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth.
