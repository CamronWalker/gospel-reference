[2 Samuel 14:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/14?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
