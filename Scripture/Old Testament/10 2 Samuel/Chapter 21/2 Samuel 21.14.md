[2 Samuel 21:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/21?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.  And after that God was intreated for the land.
