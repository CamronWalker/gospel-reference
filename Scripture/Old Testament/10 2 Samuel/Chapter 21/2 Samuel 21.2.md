[2 Samuel 21:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/21?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)
