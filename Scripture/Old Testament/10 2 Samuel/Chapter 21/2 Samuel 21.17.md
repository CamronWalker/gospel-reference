[2 Samuel 21:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/21?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him.  Then the men of David sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of Israel.
