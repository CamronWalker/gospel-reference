[2 Samuel 21:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/21?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) THEN there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD.  And the LORD answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the Gibeonites.
