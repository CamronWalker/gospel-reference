[2 Samuel 20:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway.  And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.
