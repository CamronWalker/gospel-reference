[2 Samuel 20:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand: so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.  So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of Bichri.
