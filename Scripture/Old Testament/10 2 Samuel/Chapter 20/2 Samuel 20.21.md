[2 Samuel 20:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart from the city.  And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
