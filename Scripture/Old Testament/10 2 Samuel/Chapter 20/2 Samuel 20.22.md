[2 Samuel 20:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/20?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom.  And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab.  And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the city, every man to his tent.  And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
