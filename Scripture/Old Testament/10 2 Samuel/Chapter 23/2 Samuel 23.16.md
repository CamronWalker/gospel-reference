[2 Samuel 23:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/23?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.
