[2 Samuel 23:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/23?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.
