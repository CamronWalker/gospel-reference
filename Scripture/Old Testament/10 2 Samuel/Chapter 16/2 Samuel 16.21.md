[2 Samuel 16:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/16?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.
