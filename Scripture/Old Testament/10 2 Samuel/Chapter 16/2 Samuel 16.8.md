[2 Samuel 16:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/16?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.
