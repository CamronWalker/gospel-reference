[2 Samuel 24:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/24?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing.  So David bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.
