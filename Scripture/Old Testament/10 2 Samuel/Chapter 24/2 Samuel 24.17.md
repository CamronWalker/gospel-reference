[2 Samuel 24:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/24?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done?  let thine hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's house.
