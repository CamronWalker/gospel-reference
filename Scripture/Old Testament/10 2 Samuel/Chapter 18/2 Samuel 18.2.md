[2 Samuel 18:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/18?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ittai the Gittite.  And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
