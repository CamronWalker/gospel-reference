[2 Samuel 18:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/18?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well.  And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.
