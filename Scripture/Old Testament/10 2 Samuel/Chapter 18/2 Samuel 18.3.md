[2 Samuel 18:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/18?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city.
