[2 Samuel 3:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/3?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth.  And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.
