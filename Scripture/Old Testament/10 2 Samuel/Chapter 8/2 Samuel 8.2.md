[2 Samuel 8:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/8?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.  And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
