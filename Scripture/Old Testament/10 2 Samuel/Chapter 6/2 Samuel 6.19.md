[2 Samuel 6:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/6?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of wine.  So all the people departed every one to his house.
