[2 Samuel 1:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/1?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
