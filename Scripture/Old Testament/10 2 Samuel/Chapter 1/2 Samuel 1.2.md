[2 Samuel 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
