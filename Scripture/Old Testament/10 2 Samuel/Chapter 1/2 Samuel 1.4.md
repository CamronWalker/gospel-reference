[2 Samuel 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And David said unto him, How went the matter?  I pray thee, tell me.  And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
