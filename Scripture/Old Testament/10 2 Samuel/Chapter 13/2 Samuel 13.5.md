[2 Samuel 13:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/13?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat, and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it at her hand.
