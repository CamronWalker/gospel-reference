[2 Samuel 13:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/13?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother been with thee?  but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy brother; regard not this thing.  So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.
