[2 Samuel 13:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/13?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
