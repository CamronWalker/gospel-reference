[2 Samuel 2:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever?  knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end?  how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren?
