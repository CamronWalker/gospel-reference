[2 Samuel 2:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/2?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.
