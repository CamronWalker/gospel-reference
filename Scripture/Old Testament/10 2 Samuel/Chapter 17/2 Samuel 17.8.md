[2 Samuel 17:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.
