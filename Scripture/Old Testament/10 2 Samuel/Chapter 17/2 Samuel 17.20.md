[2 Samuel 17:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan?  And the woman said unto them, They be gone over the brook of water.  And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
