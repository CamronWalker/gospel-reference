[2 Samuel 17:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-sam/17?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one.
