[Amos 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
