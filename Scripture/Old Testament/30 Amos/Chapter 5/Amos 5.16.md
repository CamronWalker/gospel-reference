[Amos 5:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/5?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
