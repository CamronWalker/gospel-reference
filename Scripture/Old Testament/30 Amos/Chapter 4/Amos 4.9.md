[Amos 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
