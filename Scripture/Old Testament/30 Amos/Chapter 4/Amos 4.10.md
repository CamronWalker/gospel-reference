[Amos 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.
