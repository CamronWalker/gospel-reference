[Amos 4:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/4?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not withered.
