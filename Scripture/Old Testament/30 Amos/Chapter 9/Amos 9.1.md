[Amos 9:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/9?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) I SAW the Lord standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.
