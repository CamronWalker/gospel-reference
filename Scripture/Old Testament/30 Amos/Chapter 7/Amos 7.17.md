[Amos 7:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/amos/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.
