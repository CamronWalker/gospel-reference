[Exodus 28:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/28?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.
