[Exodus 28:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/28?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And these are the garments which they shall make; a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me in the priest's office.
