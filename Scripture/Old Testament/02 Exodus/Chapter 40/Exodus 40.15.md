[Exodus 40:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/40?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.
