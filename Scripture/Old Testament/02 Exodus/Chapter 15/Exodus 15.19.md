[Exodus 15:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/15?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.
