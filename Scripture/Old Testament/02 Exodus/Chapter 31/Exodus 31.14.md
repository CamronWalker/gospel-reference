[Exodus 31:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
