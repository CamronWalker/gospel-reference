[Exodus 31:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you.
