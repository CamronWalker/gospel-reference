[Exodus 16:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/16?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we?  your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.
