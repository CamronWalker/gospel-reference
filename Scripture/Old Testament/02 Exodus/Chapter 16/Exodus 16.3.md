[Exodus 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
