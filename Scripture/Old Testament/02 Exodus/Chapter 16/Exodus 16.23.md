[Exodus 16:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/16?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.
