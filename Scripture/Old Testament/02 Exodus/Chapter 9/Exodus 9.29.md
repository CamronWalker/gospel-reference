[Exodus 9:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/9?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.
