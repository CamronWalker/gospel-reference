[Exodus 30:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/30?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
