[Exodus 30:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/30?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.
