[Exodus 30:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/30?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.
