[Exodus 21:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/21?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Â¶ If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.
