[Exodus 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother?  I know that he can speak well.  And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
