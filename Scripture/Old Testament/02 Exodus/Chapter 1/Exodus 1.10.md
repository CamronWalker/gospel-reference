[Exodus 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.
