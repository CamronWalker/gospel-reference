[Exodus 10:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/10?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
