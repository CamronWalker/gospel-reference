[Exodus 19:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/19?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.
