[Exodus 12:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/12?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.
