[Exodus 12:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/12?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses.  And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
