[Exodus 12:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/12?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.
