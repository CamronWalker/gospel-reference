[Exodus 12:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/12?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
