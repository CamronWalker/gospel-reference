[Exodus 33:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/33?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.
