[Exodus 33:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/33?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation.  And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.
