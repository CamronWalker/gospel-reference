[Exodus 33:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/33?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight?  is it not in that thou goest with us?  so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth.
