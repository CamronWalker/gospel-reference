[Exodus 22:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/22?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
