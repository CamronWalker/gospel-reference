[Exodus 14:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/14?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
