[Exodus 14:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?  For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.
