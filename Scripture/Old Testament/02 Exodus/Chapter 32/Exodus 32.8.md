[Exodus 32:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/32?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
