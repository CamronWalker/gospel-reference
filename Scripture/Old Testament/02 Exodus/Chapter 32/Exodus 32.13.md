[Exodus 32:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/32?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.
