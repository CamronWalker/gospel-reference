[Exodus 17:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/17?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
