[Exodus 34:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/34?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Â¶ And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee.
