[Exodus 34:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/34?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck.  All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem.  And none shall appear before me empty.
