[Exodus 34:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/34?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
