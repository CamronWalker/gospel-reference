[Exodus 29:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/29?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave offering unto the LORD.
