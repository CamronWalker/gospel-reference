[Exodus 23:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/23?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
