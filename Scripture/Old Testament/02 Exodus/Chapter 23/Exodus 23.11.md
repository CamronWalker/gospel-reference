[Exodus 23:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/23?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat.  In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
