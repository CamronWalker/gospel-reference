[Exodus 25:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/25?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.
