[Exodus 18:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ex/18?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
