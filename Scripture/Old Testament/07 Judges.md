[Judges 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which Joshua left when he died: ^c2v21

[Judges 2:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/2?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not. ^c2v22

[Judges 2:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/2?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua. ^c2v23

[Judges 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the land had rest forty years.  And Othniel the son of Kenaz died. ^c3v11

[Judges 3:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) ¶ And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. ^c3v12

[Judges 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees. ^c3v13

[Judges 3:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. ^c3v14

[Judges 3:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab. ^c3v15

[Judges 3:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. ^c3v16

[Judges 3:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man. ^c3v17

[Judges 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. ^c3v18

[Judges 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence.  And all that stood by him went out from him. ^c3v19

[Judges 3:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone.  And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee.  And he arose out of his seat. ^c3v20

[Judges 3:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: ^c3v21

[Judges 3:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. ^c3v22

[Judges 3:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. ^c3v23

[Judges 3:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. ^c3v24

[Judges 3:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. ^c3v25

[Judges 3:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. ^c3v26

[Judges 3:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them. ^c3v27

[Judges 3:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.  And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over. ^c3v28

[Judges 3:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. ^c3v29

[Judges 3:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.  And the land had rest fourscore years. ^c3v30

[Judges 4:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/4?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the LORD, when Ehud was dead. ^c4v1

[Judges 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles. ^c4v2

[Judges 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of Israel. ^c4v3

[Judges 7:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. ^c7v5

[Judges 7:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. ^c7v6

[Judges 7:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place. ^c7v7

[Judges 7:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. ^c7v12

[Judges 7:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. ^c7v13

[Judges 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. ^c7v14

[Judges 7:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) ¶ And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. ^c7v15
