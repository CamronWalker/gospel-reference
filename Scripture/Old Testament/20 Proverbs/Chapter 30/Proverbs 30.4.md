[Proverbs 30:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/30?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?  who hath gathered the wind in his fists?  who hath bound the waters in a garment?  who hath established all the ends of the earth?  what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?
