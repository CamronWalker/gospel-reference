[Proverbs 24:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/prov/24?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it?  and he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?  and shall not he render to every man according to his works?
