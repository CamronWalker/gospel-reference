[Judges 9:49](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/9?lang=eng&id=p49#p49) And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
