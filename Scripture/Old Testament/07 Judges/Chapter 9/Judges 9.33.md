[Judges 9:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/9?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
