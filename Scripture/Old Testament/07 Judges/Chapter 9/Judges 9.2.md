[Judges 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you?  remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
