[Judges 16:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/16?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.  And he bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein.  So the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life.
