[Judges 16:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/16?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) That he told her all his heart, and said unto her,  There hath not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.
