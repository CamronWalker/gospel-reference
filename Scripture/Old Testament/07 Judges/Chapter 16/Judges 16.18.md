[Judges 16:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/16?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart.  Then the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.
