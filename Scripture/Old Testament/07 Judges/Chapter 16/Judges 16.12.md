[Judges 16:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/16?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  And there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber.  And he brake them from off his arms like a thread.
