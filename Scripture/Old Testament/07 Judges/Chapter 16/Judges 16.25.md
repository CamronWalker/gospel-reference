[Judges 16:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/16?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.  And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set him between the pillars.
