[Judges 16:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/16?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson.  And he awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before, and shake myself.  And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.
