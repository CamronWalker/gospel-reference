[Judges 11:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/11?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.
