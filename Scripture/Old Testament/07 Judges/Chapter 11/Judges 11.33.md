[Judges 11:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/11?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter.  Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
