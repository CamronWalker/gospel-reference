[Judges 11:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.  And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
