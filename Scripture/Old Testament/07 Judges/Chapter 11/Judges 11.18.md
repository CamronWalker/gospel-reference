[Judges 11:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/11?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.
