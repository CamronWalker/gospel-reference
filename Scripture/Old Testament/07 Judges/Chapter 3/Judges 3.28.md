[Judges 3:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/3?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.  And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
