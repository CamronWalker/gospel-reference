[Judges 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.
