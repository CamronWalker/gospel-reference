[Judges 5:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/5?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Have they not sped?  have they not divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?
