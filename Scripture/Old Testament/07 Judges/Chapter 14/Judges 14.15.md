[Judges 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: have ye called us to take that we have?  is it not so?
