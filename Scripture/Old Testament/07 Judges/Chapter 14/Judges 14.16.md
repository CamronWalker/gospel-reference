[Judges 14:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/14?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast not told it me.  And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?
