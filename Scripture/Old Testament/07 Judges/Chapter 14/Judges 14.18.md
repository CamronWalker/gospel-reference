[Judges 14:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/14?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey?  and what is stronger than a lion?  And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.
