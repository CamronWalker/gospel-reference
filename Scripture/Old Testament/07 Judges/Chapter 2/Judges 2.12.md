[Judges 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.
