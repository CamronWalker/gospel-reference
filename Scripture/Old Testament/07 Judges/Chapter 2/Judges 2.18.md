[Judges 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
