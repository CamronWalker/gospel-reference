[Judges 13:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/13?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
