[Judges 13:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/13?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD.  For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.
