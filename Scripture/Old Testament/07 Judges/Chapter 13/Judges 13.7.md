[Judges 13:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/13?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
