[Judges 20:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/20?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?  And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.
