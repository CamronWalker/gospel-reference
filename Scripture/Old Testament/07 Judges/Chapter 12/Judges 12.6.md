[Judges 12:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.  Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand.
