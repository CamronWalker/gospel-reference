[Judges 12:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/12?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.
