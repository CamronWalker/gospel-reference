[Judges 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me?
