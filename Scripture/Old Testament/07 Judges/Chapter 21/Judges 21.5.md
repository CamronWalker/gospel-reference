[Judges 21:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/21?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?  For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
