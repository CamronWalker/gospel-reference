[Judges 4:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/4?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and weary.  So he died.
