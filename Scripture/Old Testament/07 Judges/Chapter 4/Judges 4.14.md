[Judges 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out before thee?  So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.
