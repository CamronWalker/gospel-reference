[Judges 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.  And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.
