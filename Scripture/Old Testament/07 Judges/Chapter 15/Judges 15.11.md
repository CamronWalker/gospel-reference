[Judges 15:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/15?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us?  what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
