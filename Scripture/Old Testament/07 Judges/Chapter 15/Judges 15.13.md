[Judges 15:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/15?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.  And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock.
