[Judges 15:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/15?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Â¶ Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this?  And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion.  And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.
