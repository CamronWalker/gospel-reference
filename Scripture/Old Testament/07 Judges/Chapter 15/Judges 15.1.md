[Judges 15:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/15?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) BUT it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber.  But her father would not suffer him to go in.
