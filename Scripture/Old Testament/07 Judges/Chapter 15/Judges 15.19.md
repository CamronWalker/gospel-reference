[Judges 15:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/15?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof En-hakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.
