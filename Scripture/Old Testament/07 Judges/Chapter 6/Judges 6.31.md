[Judges 6:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/6?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal?  will ye save him?  he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar.
