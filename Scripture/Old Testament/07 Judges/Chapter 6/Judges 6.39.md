[Judges 6:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/6?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
