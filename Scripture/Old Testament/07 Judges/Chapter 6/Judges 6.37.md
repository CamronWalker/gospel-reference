[Judges 6:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/6?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said.
