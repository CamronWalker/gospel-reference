[Judges 6:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/6?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Â¶ Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes.  Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight.
