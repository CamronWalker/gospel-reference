[Judges 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Â¶ Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.
