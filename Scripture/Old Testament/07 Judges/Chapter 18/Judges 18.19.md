[Judges 18:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/18?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in Israel?
