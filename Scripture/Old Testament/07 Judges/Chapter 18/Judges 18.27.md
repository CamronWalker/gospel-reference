[Judges 18:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/18?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
