[Judges 18:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/18?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) IN those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel.
