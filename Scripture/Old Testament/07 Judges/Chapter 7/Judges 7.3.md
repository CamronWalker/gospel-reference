[Judges 7:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from mount Gilead.  And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.
