[Judges 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Beth-shittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abel-meholah, unto Tabbath.
