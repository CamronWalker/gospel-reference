[Judges 7:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/judg/7?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go.
