[Deuteronomy 21:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/21?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
