[Deuteronomy 15:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/15?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou doest.
