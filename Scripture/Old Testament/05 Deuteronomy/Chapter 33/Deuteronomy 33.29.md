[Deuteronomy 33:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/33?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy excellency!  and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
