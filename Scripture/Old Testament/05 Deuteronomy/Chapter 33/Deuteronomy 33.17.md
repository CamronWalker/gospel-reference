[Deuteronomy 33:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/33?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.
