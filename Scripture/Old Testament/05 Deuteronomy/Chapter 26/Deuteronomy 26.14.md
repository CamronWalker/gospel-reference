[Deuteronomy 26:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/26?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
