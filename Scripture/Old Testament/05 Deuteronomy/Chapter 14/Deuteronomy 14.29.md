[Deuteronomy 14:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/14?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.
