[Deuteronomy 14:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/14?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Â¶ Ye shall not eat of any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God.  Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.
