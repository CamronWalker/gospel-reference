[Deuteronomy 14:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/14?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the LORD thy God always.
