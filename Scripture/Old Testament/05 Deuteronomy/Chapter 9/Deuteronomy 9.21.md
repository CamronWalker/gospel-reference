[Deuteronomy 9:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
