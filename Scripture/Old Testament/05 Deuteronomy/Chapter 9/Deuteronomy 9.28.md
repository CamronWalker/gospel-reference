[Deuteronomy 9:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
