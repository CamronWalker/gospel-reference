[Deuteronomy 9:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
