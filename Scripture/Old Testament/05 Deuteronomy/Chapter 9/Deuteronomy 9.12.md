[Deuteronomy 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
