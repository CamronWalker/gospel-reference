[Deuteronomy 9:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
