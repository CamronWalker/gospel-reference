[Deuteronomy 9:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) ¶ Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.
