[Deuteronomy 9:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/9?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
