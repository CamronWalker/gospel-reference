[Deuteronomy 12:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/12?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.
