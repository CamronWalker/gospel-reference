[Deuteronomy 12:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/12?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods.
