[Deuteronomy 12:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/12?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.
