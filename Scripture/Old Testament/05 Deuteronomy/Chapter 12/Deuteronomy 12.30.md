[Deuteronomy 12:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/12?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods?  even so will I do likewise.
