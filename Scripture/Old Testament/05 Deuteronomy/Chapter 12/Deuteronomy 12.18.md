[Deuteronomy 12:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/12?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.
