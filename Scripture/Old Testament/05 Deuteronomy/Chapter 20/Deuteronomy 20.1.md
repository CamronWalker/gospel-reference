[Deuteronomy 20:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/20?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) WHEN thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
