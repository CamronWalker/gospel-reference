[Deuteronomy 31:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/31?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.
