[Deuteronomy 31:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/31?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Â¶ And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.
