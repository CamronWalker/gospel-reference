[Deuteronomy 31:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/31?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.
