[Deuteronomy 29:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/29?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.
