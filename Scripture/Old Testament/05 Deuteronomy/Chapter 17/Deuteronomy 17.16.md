[Deuteronomy 17:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/17?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way.
