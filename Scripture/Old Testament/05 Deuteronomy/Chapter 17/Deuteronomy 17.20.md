[Deuteronomy 17:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/17?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
