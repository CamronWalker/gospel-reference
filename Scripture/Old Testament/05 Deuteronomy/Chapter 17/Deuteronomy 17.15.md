[Deuteronomy 17:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/17?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother.
