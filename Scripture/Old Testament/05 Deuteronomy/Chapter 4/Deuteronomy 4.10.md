[Deuteronomy 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
