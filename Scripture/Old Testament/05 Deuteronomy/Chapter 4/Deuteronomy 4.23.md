[Deuteronomy 4:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/4?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee.
