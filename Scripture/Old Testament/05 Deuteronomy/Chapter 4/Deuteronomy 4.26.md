[Deuteronomy 4:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall utterly be destroyed.
