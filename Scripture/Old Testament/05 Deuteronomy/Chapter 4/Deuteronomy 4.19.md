[Deuteronomy 4:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/4?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven.
