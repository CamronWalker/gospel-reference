[Deuteronomy 4:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/4?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it?
