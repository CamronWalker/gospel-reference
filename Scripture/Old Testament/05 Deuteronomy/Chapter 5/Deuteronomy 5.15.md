[Deuteronomy 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and that the  LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.
