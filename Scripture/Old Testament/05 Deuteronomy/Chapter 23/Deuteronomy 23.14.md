[Deuteronomy 23:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/23?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
