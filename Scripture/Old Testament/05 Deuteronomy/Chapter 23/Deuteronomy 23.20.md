[Deuteronomy 23:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/23?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
