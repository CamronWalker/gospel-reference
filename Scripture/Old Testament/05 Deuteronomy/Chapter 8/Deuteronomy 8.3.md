[Deuteronomy 8:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/8?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.
