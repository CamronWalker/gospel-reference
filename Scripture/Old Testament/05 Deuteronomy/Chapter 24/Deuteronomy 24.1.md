[Deuteronomy 24:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/24?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) WHEN a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.
