[Deuteronomy 24:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/24?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Â¶ When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the work of thine hands.
