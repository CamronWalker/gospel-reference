[Deuteronomy 24:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/24?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.
