[Deuteronomy 28:67](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/28?lang=eng&id=p67#p67) In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even!  and at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning!  for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
