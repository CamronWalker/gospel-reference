[Deuteronomy 28:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/28?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.
