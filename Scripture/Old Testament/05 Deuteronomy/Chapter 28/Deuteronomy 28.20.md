[Deuteronomy 28:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/28?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.
