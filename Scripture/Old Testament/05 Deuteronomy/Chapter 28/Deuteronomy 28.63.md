[Deuteronomy 28:63](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/28?lang=eng&id=p63#p63) And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it.
