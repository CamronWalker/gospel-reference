[Deuteronomy 28:55](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/28?lang=eng&id=p55#p55) So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
