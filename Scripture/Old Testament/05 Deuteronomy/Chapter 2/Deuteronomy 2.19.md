[Deuteronomy 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a possession.
