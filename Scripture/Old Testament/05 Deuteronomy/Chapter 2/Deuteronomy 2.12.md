[Deuteronomy 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.
