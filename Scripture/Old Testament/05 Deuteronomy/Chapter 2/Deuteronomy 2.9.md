[Deuteronomy 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a possession.
