[Deuteronomy 7:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/7?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.
