[Deuteronomy 7:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/7?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD thy God.
