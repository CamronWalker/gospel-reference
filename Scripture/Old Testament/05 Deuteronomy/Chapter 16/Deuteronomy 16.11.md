[Deuteronomy 16:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/16?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.
