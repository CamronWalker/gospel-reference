[Deuteronomy 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
