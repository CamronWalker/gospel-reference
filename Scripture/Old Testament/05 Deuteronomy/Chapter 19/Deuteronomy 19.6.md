[Deuteronomy 19:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/19?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
