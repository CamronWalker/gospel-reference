[Deuteronomy 25:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/25?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's brother.
