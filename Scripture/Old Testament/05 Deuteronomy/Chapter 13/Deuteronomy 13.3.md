[Deuteronomy 13:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/13?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul.
