[Deuteronomy 27:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/27?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place.  And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.
