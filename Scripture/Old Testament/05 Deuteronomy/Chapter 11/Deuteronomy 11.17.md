[Deuteronomy 11:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD giveth you.
