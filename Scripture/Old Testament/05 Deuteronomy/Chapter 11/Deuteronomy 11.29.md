[Deuteronomy 11:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/11?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal.
