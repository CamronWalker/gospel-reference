[Deuteronomy 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
