[Deuteronomy 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.
