[Deuteronomy 22:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/deut/22?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
