[Malachi 4:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/4?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) FOR, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
