[Malachi 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And did not he make one?  Yet had he the residue of the spirit.  And wherefore one?  That he might seek a godly seed.  Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
