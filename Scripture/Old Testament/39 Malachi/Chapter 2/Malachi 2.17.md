[Malachi 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Â¶ Ye have wearied the LORD with your words.  Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied him?  When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where is the God of judgment?
