[Malachi 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.
