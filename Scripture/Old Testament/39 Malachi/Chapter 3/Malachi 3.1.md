[Malachi 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.
