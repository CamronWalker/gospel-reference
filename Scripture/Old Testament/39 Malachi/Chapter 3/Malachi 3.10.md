[Malachi 3:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
