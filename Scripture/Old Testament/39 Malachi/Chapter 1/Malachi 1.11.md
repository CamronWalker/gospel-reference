[Malachi 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
