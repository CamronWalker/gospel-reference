[Malachi 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.
