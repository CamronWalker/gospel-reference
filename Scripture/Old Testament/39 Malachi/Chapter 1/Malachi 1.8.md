[Malachi 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?  and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?  offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?  saith the LORD of hosts.
