[Malachi 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.
