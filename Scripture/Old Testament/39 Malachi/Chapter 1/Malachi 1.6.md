[Malachi 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Â¶ A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour?  and if I be a master, where is my fear?  saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name.  And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
