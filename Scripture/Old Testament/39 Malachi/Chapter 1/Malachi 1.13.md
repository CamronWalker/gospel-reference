[Malachi 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it!  and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand?  saith the LORD.
