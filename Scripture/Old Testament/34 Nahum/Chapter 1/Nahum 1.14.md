[Nahum 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/nahum/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
