[Nahum 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/nahum/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace!  O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
