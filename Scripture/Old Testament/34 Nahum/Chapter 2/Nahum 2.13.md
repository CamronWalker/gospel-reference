[Nahum 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/nahum/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
