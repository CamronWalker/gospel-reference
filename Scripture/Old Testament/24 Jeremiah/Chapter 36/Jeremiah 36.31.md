[Jeremiah 36:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/36?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.
