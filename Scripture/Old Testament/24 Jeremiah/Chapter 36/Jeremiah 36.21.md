[Jeremiah 36:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/36?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe's chamber.  And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
