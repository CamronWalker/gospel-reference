[Jeremiah 52:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/52?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass.  The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
