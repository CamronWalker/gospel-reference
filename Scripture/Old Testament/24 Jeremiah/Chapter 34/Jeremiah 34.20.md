[Jeremiah 34:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth.
