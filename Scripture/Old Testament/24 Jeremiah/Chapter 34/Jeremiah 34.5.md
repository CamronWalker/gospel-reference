[Jeremiah 34:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD.
