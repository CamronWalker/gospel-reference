[Jeremiah 34:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.
