[Jeremiah 34:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.
