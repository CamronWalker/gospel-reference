[Jeremiah 34:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you.
