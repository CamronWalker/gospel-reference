[Jeremiah 34:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.
