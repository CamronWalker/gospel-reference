[Jeremiah 34:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/34?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let them go.
