[Jeremiah 40:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/40?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?
