[Jeremiah 37:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/37?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in the city were spent.  Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
