[Jeremiah 37:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/37?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.
