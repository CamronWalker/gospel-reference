[Jeremiah 37:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/37?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD?  And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
