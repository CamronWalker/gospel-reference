[Jeremiah 15:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/15?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Â¶ Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee; but return not thou unto them.
