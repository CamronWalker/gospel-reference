[Jeremiah 15:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/15?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD.
