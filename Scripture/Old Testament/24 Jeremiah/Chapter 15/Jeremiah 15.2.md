[Jeremiah 15:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/15?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go forth?  then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.
