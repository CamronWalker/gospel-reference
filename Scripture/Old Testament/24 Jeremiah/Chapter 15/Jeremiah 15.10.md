[Jeremiah 15:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/15?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Â¶ Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth!  I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them doth curse me.
