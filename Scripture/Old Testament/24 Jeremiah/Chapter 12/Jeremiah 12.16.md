[Jeremiah 12:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/12?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people.
