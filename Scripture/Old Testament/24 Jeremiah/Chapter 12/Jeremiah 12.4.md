[Jeremiah 12:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/12?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein?  the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end.
