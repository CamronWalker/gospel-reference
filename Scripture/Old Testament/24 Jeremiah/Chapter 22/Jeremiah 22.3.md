[Jeremiah 22:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/22?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.
