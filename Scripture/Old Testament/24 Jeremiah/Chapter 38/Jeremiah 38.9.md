[Jeremiah 38:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/38?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.
