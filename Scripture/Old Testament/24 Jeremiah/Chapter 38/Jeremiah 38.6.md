[Jeremiah 38:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/38?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords.  And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
