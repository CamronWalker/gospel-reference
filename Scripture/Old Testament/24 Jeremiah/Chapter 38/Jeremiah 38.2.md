[Jeremiah 38:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/38?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.
