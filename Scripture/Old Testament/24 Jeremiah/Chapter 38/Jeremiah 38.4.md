[Jeremiah 38:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/38?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
