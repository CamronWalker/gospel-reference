[Jeremiah 2:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/2?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.
