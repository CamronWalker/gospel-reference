[Jeremiah 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
