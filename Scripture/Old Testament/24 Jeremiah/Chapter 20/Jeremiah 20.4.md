[Jeremiah 20:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/20?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
