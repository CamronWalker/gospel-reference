[Jeremiah 20:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/20?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.
