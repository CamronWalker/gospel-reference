[Jeremiah 20:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/20?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Â¶ For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.  Report, say they, and we will report it.  All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
