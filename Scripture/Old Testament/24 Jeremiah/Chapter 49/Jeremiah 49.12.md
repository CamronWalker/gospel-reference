[Jeremiah 49:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/49?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished?  thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink of it.
