[Jeremiah 49:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/49?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the LORD.
