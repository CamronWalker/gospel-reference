[Jeremiah 49:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/49?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.
