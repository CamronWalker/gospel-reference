[Jeremiah 49:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/49?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.
