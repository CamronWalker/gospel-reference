[Jeremiah 49:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/49?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.
