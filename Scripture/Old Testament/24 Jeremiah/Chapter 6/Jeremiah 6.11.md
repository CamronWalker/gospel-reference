[Jeremiah 6:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/6?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.
