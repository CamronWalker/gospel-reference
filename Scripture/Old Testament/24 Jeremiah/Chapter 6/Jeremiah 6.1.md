[Jeremiah 6:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/6?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) O YE children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction.
