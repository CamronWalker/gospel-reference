[Jeremiah 6:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/6?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?  nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
