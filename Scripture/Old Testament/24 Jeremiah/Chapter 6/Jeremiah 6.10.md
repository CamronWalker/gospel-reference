[Jeremiah 6:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/6?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?  behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.
