[Jeremiah 4:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
