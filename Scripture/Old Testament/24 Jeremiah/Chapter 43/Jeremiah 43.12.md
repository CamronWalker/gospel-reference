[Jeremiah 43:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/43?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.
