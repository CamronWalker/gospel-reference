[Jeremiah 28:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/28?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
