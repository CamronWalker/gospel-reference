[Jeremiah 23:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.
