[Jeremiah 23:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.
