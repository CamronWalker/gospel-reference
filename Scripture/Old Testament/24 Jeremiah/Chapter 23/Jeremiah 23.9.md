[Jeremiah 23:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Â¶ Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness.
