[Jeremiah 23:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
