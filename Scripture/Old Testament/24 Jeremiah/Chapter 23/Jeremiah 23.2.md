[Jeremiah 23:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD.
