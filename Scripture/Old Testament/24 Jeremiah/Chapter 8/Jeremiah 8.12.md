[Jeremiah 8:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination?  nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD.
