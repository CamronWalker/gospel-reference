[Jeremiah 8:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.
