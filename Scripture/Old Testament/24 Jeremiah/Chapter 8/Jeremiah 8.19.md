[Jeremiah 8:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/8?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion?  is not her king in her?  Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities?
