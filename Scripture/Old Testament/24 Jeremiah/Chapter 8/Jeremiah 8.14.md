[Jeremiah 8:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Why do we sit still?  assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD.
