[Jeremiah 16:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/16?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.
