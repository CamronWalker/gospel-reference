[Jeremiah 16:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/16?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
