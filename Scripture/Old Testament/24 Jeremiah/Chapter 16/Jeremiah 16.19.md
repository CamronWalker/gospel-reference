[Jeremiah 16:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/16?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.
