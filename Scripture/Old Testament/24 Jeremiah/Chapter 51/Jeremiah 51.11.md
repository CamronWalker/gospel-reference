[Jeremiah 51:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against Babylon, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple.
