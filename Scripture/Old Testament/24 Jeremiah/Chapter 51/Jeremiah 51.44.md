[Jeremiah 51:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall.
