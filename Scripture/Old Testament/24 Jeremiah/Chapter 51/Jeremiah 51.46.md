[Jeremiah 51:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler.
