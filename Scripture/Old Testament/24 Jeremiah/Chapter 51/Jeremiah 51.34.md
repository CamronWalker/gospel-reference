[Jeremiah 51:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out.
