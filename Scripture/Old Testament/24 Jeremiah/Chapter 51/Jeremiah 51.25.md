[Jeremiah 51:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
