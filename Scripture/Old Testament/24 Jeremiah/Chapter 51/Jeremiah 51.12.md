[Jeremiah 51:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon.
