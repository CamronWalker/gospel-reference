[Jeremiah 51:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers.
