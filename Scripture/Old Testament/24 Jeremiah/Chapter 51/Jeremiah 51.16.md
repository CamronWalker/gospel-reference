[Jeremiah 51:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/51?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
