[Jeremiah 48:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/48?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Â¶ Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
