[Jeremiah 48:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/48?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they reach even to the sea of Jazer: the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
