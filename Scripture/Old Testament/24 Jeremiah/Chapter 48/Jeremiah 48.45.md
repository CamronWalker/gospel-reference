[Jeremiah 48:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/48?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
