[Jeremiah 48:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/48?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as an heifer of three years old: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be desolate.
