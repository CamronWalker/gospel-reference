[Jeremiah 48:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/48?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon it, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.
