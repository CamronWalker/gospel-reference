[Jeremiah 48:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/48?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; their shouting shall be no shouting.
