[Jeremiah 41:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/41?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey.  So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.
