[Jeremiah 41:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/41?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
