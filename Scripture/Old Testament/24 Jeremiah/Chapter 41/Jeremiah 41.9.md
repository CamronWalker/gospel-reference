[Jeremiah 41:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/41?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain.
