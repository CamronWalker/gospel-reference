[Jeremiah 11:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/11?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
