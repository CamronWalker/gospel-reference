[Jeremiah 11:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.
