[Jeremiah 32:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
