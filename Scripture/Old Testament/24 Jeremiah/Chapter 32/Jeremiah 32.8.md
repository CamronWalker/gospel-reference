[Jeremiah 32:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) So Hanameel mine uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself.  Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.
