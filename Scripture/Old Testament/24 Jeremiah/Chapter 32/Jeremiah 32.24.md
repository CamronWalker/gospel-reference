[Jeremiah 32:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.
