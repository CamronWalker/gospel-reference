[Jeremiah 32:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.
