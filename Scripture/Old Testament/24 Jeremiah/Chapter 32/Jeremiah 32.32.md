[Jeremiah 32:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
