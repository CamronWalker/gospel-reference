[Jeremiah 32:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/32?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
