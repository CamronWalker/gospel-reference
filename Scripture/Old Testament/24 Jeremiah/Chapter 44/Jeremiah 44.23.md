[Jeremiah 44:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.
