[Jeremiah 44:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows.
