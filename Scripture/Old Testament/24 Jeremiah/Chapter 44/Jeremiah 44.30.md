[Jeremiah 44:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and that sought his life.
