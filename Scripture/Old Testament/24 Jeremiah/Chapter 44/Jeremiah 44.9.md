[Jeremiah 44:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
