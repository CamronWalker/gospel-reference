[Jeremiah 44:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
