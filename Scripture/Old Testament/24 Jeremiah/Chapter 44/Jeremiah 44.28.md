[Jeremiah 44:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
