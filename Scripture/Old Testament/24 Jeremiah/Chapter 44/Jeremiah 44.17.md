[Jeremiah 44:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
