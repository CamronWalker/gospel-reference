[Jeremiah 44:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/44?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.
