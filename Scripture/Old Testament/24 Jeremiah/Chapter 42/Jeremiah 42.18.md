[Jeremiah 42:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/42?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more.
