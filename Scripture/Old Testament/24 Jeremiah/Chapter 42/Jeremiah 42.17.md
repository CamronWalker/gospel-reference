[Jeremiah 42:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/42?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
