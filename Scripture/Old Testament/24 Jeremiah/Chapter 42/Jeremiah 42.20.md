[Jeremiah 42:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/42?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do it.
