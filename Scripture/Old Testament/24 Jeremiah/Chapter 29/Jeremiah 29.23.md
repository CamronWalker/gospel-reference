[Jeremiah 29:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/29?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD.
