[Jeremiah 29:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/29?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.
