[Jeremiah 29:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/29?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.
