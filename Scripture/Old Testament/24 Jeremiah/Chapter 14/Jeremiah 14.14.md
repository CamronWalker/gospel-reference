[Jeremiah 14:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/14?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their heart.
