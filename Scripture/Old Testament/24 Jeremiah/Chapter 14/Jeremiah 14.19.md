[Jeremiah 14:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/14?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Hast thou utterly rejected Judah?  hath thy soul lothed Zion?  why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
