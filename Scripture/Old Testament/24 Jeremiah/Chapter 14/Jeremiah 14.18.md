[Jeremiah 14:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/14?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword!  and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine!  yea, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not.
