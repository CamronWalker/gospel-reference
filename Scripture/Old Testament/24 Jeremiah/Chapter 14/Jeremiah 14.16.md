[Jeremiah 14:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/14?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
