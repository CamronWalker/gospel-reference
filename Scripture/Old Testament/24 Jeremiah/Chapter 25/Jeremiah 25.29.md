[Jeremiah 25:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/25?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?  Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts.
