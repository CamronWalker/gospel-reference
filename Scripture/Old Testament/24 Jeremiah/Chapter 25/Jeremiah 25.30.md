[Jeremiah 25:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/25?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
