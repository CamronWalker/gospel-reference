[Jeremiah 25:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/25?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
