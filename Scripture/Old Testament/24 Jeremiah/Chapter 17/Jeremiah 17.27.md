[Jeremiah 17:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/17?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
