[Jeremiah 17:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/17?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, which shall burn for ever.
