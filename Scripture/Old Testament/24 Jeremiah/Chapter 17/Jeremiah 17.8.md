[Jeremiah 17:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/17?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
