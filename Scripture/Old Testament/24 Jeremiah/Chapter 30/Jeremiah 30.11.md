[Jeremiah 30:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/30?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished.
