[Jeremiah 30:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/30?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Â¶ Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.
