[Jeremiah 30:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/30?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.
