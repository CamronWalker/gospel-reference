[Jeremiah 30:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/30?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
