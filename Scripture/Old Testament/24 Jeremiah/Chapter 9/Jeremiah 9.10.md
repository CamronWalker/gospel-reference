[Jeremiah 9:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.
