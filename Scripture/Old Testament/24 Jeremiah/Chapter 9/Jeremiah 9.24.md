[Jeremiah 9:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/9?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.
