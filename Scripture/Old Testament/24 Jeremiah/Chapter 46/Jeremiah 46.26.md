[Jeremiah 46:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/46?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the LORD.
