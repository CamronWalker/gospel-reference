[Jeremiah 46:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/46?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For this is the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates.
