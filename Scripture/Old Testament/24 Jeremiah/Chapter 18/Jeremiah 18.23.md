[Jeremiah 18:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/18?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thine anger.
