[Jeremiah 13:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/13?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields.  Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem!  wilt thou not be made clean?  when shall it once be?
