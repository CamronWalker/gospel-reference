[Jeremiah 13:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/13?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
