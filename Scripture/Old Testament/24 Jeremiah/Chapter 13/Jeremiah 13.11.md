[Jeremiah 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
