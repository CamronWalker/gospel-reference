[Jeremiah 13:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
