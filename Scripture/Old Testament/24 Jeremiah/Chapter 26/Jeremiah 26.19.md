[Jeremiah 26:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/26?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death?  did he not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them?  Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.
