[Jeremiah 26:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/26?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?  And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
