[Jeremiah 31:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither.
