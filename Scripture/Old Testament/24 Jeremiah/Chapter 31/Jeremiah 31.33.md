[Jeremiah 31:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.
