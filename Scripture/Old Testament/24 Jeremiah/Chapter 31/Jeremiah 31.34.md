[Jeremiah 31:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
