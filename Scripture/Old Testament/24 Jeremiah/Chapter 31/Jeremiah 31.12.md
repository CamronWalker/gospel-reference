[Jeremiah 31:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
