[Jeremiah 31:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.
