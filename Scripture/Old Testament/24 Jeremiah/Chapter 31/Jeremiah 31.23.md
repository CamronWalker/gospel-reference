[Jeremiah 31:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.
