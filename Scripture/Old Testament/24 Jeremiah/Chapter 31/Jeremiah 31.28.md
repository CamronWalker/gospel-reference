[Jeremiah 31:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/31?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the LORD.
