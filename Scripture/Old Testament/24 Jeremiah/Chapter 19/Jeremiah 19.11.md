[Jeremiah 19:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/19?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury.
