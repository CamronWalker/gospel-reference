[Jeremiah 19:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/19?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
