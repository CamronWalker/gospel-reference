[Jeremiah 19:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/19?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle.
