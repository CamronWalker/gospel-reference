[Jeremiah 19:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/19?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.
