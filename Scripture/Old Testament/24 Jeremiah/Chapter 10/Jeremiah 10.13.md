[Jeremiah 10:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.
