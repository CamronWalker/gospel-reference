[Jeremiah 10:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/10?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
