[Jeremiah 21:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/21?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.
