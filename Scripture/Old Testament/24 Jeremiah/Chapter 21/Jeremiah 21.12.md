[Jeremiah 21:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/21?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.
