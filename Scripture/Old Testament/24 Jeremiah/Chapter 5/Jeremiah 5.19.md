[Jeremiah 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Â¶ And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD our God all these things unto us?  then shalt thou answer them, Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
