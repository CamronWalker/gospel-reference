[Jeremiah 5:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) O LORD, are not thine eyes upon the truth?  thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.
