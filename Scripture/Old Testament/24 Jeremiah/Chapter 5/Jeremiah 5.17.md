[Jeremiah 5:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/5?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.
