[Jeremiah 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.
