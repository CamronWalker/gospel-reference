[Jeremiah 27:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/27?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
