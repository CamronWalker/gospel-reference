[Jeremiah 27:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/27?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
