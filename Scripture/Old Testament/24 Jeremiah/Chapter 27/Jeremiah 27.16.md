[Jeremiah 27:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/27?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD's house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.
