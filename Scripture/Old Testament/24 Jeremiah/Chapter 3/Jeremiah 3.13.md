[Jeremiah 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD.
