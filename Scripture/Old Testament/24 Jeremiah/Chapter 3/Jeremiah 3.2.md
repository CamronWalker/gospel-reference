[Jeremiah 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with.  In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
