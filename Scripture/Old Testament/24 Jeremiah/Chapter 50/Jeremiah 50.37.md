[Jeremiah 50:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
