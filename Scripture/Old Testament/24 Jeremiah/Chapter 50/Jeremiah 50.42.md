[Jeremiah 50:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
