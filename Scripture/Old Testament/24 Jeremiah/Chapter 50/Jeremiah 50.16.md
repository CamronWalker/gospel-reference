[Jeremiah 50:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
