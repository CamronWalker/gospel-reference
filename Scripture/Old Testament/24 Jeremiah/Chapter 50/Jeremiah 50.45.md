[Jeremiah 50:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.
