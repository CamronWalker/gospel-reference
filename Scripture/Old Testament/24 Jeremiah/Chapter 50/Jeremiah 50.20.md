[Jeremiah 50:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
