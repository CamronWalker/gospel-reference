[Jeremiah 50:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
