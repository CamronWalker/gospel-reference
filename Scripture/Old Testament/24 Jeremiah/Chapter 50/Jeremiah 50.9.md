[Jeremiah 50:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) ¶ For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
