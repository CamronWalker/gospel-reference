[Jeremiah 50:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
