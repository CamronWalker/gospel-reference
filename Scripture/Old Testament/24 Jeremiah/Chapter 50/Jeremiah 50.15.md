[Jeremiah 50:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
