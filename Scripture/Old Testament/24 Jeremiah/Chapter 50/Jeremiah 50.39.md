[Jeremiah 50:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/50?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
