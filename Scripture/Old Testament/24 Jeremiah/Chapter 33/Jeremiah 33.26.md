[Jeremiah 33:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/33?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them.
