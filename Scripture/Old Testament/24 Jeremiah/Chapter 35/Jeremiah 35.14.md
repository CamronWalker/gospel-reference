[Jeremiah 35:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/35?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me.
