[Jeremiah 35:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jer/35?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
