[Ecclesiastes 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Â¶ If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he.
