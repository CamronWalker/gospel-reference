[Ecclesiastes 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.
