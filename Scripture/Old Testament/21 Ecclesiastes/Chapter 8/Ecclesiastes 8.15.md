[Ecclesiastes 8:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/8?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
