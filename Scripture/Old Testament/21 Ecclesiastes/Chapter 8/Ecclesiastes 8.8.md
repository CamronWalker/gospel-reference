[Ecclesiastes 8:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/8?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
