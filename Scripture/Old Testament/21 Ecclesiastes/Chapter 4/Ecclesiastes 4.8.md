[Ecclesiastes 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?  This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.
