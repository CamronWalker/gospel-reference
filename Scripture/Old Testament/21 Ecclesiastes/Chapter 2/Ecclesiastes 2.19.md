[Ecclesiastes 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool?  yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun.  This is also vanity.
