[Ecclesiastes 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
