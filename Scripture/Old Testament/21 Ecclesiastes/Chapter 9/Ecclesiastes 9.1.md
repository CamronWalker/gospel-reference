[Ecclesiastes 9:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/9?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) FOR all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them.
