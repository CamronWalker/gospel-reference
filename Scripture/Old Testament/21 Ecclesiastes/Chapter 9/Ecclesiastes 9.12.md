[Ecclesiastes 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon them.
