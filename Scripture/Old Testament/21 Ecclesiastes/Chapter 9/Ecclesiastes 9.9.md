[Ecclesiastes 9:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/9?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.
