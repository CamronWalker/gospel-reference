[Ecclesiastes 9:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/9?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
