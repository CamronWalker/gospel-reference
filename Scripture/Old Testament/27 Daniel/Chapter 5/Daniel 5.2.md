[Daniel 5:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/5?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein.
