[Daniel 5:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/5?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
