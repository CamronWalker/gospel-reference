[Daniel 3:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/3?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.
