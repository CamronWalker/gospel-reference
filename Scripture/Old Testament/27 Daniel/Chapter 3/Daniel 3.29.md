[Daniel 3:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/3?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.
