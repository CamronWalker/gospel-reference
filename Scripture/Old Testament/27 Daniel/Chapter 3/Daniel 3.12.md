[Daniel 3:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/3?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
