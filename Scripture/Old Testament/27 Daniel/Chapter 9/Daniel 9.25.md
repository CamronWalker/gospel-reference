[Daniel 9:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/9?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
