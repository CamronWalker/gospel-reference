[Daniel 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon Jerusalem.
