[Daniel 9:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/9?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
