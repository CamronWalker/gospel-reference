[Daniel 9:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/9?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
