[Daniel 9:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.
