[Daniel 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort?  then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king.
