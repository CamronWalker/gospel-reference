[Daniel 6:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/6?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
