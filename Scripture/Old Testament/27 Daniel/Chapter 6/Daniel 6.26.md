[Daniel 6:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/6?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end.
