[Daniel 11:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.
