[Daniel 11:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.
