[Daniel 11:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.
