[Daniel 11:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.
