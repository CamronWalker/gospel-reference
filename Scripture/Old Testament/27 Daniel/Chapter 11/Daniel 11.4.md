[Daniel 11:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
