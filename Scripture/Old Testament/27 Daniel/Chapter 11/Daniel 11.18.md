[Daniel 11:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him.
