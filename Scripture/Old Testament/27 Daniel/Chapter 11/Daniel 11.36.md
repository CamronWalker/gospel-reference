[Daniel 11:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.
