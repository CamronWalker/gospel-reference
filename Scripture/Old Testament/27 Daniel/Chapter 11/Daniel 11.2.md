[Daniel 11:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And now will I shew thee the truth.  Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
