[Daniel 11:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.
