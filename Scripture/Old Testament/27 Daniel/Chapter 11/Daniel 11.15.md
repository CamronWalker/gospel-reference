[Daniel 11:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/11?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any strength to withstand.
