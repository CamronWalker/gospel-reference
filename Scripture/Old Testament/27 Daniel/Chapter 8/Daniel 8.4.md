[Daniel 8:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/8?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
