[Daniel 8:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/8?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.
