[Daniel 10:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/10?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto thee am I now sent.  And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.
