[Daniel 10:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/10?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
