[Daniel 4:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/4?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Â¶ Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him.  The king spake, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble thee.  Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
