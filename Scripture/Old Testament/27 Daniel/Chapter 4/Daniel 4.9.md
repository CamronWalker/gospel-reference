[Daniel 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.
