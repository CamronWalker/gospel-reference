[Daniel 4:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/4?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me; and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me.
