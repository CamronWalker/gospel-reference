[Daniel 4:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/4?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen.  Now thou, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.
