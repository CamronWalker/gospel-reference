[Daniel 4:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.
