[Daniel 12:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) AND at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
