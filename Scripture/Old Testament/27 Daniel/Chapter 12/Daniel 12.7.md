[Daniel 12:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/12?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people, all these things shall be finished.
