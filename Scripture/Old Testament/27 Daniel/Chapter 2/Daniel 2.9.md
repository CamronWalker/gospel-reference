[Daniel 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof.
