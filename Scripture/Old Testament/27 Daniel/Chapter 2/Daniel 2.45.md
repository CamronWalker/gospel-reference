[Daniel 2:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.
