[Daniel 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) ¶ The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.
