[Daniel 2:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.
