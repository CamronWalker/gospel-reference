[Daniel 2:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/dan/2?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters' clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.
