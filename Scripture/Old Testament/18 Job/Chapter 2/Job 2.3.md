[Job 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
