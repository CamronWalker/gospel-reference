[Job 42:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/42?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
