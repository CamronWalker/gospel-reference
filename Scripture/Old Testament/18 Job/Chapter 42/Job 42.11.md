[Job 42:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/job/42?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
