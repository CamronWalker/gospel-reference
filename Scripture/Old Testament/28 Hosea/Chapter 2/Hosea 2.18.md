[Hosea 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them to lie down safely.
