[Hosea 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then was it better with me than now.
