[Hosea 9:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: but they went to Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto that shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.
