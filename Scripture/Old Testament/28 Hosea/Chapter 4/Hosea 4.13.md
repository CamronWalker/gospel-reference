[Hosea 4:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
