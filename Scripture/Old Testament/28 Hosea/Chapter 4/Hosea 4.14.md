[Hosea 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.
