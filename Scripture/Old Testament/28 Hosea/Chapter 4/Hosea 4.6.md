[Hosea 4:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hosea/4?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Â¶ My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
