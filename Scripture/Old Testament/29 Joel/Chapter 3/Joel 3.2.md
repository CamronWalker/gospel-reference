[Joel 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.
