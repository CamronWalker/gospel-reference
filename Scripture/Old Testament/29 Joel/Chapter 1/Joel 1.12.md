[Joel 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.
