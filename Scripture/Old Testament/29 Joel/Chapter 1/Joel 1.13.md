[Joel 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.
