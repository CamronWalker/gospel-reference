[Joel 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations.
