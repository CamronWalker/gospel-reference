[Joel 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/joel/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?
