[Malachi 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee?  In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible. ^c1v7

[Malachi 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?  and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?  offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?  saith the LORD of hosts. ^c1v8

[Malachi 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?  saith the LORD of hosts. ^c1v9

[Malachi 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?  neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought.  I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand. ^c1v10

[Malachi 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts. ^c1v11

[Malachi 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it!  and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand?  saith the LORD. ^c1v13

[Malachi 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen. ^c1v14

[Malachi 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take you away with it. ^c2v3

[Malachi 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law. ^c2v9

[Malachi 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Have we not all one father?  hath not one God created us?  why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers? ^c2v10

[Malachi 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with good will at your hand. ^c2v13

[Malachi 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) ¶ Yet ye say, Wherefore?

[Malachi 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts. ^c3v1

[Malachi 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) But who may abide the day of his coming?  and who shall stand when he appeareth?  for he is like a refiner's fire, and like fullers' soap: ^c3v2

[Malachi 3:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And he shall sit as a refiner and purifer of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. ^c3v3
