[Haggai 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hag/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Â¶ Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the LORD.
