[Haggai 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hag/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.
