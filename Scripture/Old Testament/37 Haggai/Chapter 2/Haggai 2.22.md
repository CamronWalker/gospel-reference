[Haggai 2:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hag/2?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword of his brother.
