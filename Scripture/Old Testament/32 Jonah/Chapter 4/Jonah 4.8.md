[Jonah 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jonah/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
