[Jonah 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jonah/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?  Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.
