[Jonah 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jonah/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.
