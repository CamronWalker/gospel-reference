[Jonah 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jonah/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them.  But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
