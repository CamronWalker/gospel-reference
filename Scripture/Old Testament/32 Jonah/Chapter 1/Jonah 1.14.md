[Jonah 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/jonah/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee.
