[Nehemiah 9:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
