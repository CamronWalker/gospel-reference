[Nehemiah 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
