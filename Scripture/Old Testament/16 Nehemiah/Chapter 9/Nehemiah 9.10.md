[Nehemiah 9:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them.  So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.
