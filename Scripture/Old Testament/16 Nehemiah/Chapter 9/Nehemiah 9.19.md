[Nehemiah 9:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.
