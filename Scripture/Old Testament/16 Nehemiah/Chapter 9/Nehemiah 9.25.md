[Nehemiah 9:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/9?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
