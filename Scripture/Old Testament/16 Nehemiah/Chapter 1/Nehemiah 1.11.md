[Nehemiah 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man.  For I was the king's cupbearer.
