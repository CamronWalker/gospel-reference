[Nehemiah 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's house have sinned.
