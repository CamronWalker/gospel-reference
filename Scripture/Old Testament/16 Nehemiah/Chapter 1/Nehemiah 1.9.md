[Nehemiah 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.
