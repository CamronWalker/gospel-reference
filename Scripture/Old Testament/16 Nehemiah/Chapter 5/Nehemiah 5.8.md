[Nehemiah 5:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren?  or shall they be sold unto us?  Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.
