[Nehemiah 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me.  And they said, Let us rise up and build.  So they strengthened their hands for this good work.
