[Nehemiah 6:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/6?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.
