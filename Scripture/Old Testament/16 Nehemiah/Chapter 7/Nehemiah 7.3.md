[Nehemiah 7:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/7?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.
