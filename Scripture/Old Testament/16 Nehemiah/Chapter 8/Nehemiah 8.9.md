[Nehemiah 8:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/8?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Â¶ And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.  For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.
