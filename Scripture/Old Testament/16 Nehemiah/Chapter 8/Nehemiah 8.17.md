[Nehemiah 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so.  And there was very great gladness.
