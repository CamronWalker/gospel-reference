[Nehemiah 8:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.
