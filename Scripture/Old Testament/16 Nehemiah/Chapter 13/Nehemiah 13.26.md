[Nehemiah 13:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/13?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things?  yet among many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin.
