[Nehemiah 13:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/13?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Â¶ In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
