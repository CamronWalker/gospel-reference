[Nehemiah 13:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/13?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.  Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
