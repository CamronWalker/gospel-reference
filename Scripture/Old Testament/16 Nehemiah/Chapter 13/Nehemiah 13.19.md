[Nehemiah 13:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/13?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
