[Nehemiah 13:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/13?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
