[Nehemiah 10:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/10?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.
