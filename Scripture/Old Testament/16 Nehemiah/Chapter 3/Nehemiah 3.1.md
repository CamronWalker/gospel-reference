[Nehemiah 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) THEN Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.
