[Nehemiah 12:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/neh/12?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.
