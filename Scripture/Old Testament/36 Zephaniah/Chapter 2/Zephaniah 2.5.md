[Zephaniah 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites!  the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
