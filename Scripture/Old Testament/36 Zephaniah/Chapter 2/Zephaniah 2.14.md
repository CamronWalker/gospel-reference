[Zephaniah 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he shall uncover the cedar work.
