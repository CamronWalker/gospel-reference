[Zephaniah 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.
