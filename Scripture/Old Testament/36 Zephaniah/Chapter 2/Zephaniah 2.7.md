[Zephaniah 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity.
