[Zephaniah 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain.
