[Zephaniah 3:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/3?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Â¶ Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.
