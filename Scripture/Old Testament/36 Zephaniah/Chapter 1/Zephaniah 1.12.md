[Zephaniah 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.
