[Zephaniah 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zeph/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.
