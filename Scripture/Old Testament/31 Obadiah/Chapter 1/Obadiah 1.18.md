[Obadiah 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/obad/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken it.
