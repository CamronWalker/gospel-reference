[Obadiah 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/obad/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee, and prevailed against thee; they that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.
