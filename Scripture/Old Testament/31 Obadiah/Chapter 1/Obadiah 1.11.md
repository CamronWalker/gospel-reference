[Obadiah 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/obad/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
