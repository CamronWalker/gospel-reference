[Obadiah 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/obad/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
