[Ruth 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.
