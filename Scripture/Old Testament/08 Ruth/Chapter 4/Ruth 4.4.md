[Ruth 4:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people.  If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I am after thee.  And he said, I will redeem it.
