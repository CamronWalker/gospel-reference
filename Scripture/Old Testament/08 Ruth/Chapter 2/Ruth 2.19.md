[Ruth 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to day?  and where wroughtest thou?  blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.  And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.
