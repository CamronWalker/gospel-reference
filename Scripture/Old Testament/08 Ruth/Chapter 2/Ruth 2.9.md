[Ruth 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee?  and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
