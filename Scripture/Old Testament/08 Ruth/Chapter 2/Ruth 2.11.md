[Ruth 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ruth/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore.
