[Esther 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and that she were called by name.
