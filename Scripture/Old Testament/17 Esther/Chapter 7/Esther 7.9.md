[Esther 7:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/7?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king, Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.  Then the king said, Hang him thereon.
