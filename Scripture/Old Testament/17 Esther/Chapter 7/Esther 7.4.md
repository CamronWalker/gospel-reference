[Esther 7:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/7?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish.  But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not countervail the king's damage.
