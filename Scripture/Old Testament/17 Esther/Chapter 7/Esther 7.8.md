[Esther 7:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed whereon Esther was.  Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house?  As the word went out of the king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.
