[Esther 6:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/6?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him.  Then said his wise men and Zeresh his wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
