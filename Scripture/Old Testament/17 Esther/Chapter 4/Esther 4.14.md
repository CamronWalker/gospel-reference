[Esther 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
