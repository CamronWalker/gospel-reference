[Esther 4:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/4?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish.
