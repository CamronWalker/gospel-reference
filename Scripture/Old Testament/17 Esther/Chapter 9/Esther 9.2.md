[Esther 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.
