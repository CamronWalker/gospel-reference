[Esther 9:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/9?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.
