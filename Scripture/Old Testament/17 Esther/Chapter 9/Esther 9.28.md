[Esther 9:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/9?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
