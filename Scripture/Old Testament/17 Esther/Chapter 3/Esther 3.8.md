[Esther 3:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/3?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) ¶ And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not for the king's profit to suffer them.
