[Esther 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) If it please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king's treasuries.
