[Esther 5:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/5?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand.  So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.
