[Esther 5:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/5?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Â¶ Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak thou unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet.  And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.
