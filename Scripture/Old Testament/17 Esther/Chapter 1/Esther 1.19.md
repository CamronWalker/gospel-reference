[Esther 1:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/esth/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
