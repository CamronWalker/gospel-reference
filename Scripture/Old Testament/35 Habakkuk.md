[Habakkuk 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!  even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save! ^c1v2

[Habakkuk 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance?  for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. ^c1v3

[Habakkuk 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. ^c1v4

[Habakkuk 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) ¶ Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you. ^c1v5

[Habakkuk 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs. ^c1v6

[Habakkuk 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. ^c1v7

[Habakkuk 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat. ^c1v8

[Habakkuk 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. ^c1v9

[Habakkuk 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it. ^c1v10

[Habakkuk 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god. ^c1v11

[Habakkuk 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) ¶ Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?  we shall not die.  O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction. ^c1v12

[Habakkuk 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he? ^c1v13

[Habakkuk 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? ^c1v14

[Habakkuk 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. ^c1v15

[Habakkuk 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous. ^c1v16

[Habakkuk 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? ^c1v17

[Habakkuk 2:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/2?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his!  how long?  and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! ^c2v6

[Habakkuk 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? ^c2v7

[Habakkuk 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. ^c2v8
