[Isaiah 28:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/28?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.
