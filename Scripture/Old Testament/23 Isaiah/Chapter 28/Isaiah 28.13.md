[Isaiah 28:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/28?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.
