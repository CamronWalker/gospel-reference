[Isaiah 45:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/45?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the LORD; and there is none else.
