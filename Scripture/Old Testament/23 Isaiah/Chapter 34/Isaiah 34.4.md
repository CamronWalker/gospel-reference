[Isaiah 34:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/34?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a falling fig from the fig tree.
