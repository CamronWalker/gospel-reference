[Isaiah 51:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/51?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
