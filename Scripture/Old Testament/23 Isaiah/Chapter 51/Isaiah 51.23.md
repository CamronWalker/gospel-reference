[Isaiah 51:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/51?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
