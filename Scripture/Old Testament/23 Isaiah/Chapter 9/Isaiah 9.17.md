[Isaiah 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly.  For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
