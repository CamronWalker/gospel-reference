[Isaiah 50:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/50?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that ye have kindled.  This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
