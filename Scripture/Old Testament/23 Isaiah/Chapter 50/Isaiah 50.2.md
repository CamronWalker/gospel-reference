[Isaiah 50:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/50?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Wherefore, when I came, was there no man?  when I called, was there none to answer?  Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem?  or have I no power to deliver?  behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for thirst.
