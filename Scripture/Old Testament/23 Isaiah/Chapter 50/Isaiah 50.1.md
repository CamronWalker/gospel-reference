[Isaiah 50:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/50?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) THUS saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's divorcement, whom I have put away?  or which of my creditors is it to whom I have sold you?  Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.
