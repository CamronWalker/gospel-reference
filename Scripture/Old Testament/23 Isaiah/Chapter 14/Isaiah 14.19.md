[Isaiah 14:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/14?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under feet.
