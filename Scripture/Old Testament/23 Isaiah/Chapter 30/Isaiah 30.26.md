[Isaiah 30:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/30?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.
