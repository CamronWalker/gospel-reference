[Isaiah 30:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/30?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures.
