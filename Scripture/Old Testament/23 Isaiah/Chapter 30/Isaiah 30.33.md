[Isaiah 30:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/30?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it.
