[Isaiah 30:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/30?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.
