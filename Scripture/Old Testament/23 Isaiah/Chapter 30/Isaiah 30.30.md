[Isaiah 30:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/30?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.
