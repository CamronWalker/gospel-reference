[Isaiah 47:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/47?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.
