[Isaiah 16:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/16?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.
