[Isaiah 49:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
