[Isaiah 49:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Â¶ Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee.  As I live, saith the LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.
