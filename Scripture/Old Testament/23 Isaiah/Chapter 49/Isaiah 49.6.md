[Isaiah 49:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.
