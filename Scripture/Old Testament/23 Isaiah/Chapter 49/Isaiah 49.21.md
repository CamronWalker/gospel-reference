[Isaiah 49:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro?  and who hath brought up these?  Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
