[Isaiah 49:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/49?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.
