[Isaiah 66:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/66?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol.  Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations.
