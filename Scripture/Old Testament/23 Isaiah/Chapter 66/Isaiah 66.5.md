[Isaiah 66:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/66?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Â¶ Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.
