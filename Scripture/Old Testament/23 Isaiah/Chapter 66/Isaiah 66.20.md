[Isaiah 66:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/66?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.
