[Isaiah 66:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/66?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
