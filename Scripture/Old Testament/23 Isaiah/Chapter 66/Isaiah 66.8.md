[Isaiah 66:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/66?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Who hath heard such a thing?  who hath seen such things?  Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day?  or shall a nation be born at once?  for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.
