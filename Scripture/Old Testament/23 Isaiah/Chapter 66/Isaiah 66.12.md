[Isaiah 66:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/66?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her knees.
