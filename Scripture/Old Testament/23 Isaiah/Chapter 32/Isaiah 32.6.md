[Isaiah 32:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/32?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.
