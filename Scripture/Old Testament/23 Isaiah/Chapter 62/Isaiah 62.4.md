[Isaiah 62:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/62?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
