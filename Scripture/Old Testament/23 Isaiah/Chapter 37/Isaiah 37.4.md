[Isaiah 37:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/37?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left.
