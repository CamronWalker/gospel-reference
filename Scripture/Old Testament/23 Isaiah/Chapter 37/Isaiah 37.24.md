[Isaiah 37:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/37?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of his Carmel.
