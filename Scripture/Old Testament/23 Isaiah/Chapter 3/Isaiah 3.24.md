[Isaiah 3:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/3?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.
