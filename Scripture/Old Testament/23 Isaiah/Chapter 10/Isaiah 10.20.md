[Isaiah 10:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/10?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Â¶ And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.
