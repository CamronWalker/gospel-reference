[Isaiah 10:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/10?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?  or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?  as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.
