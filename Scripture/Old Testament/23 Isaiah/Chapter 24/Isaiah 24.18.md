[Isaiah 24:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake.
