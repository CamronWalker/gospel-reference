[Isaiah 24:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/24?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.
