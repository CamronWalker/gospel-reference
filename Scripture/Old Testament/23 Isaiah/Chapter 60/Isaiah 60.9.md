[Isaiah 60:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/60?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.
