[Isaiah 40:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/40?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.
