[Isaiah 40:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/40?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.
