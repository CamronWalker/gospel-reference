[Isaiah 65:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/65?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.
