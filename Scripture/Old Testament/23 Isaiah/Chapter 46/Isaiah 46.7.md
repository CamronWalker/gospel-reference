[Isaiah 46:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/46?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
