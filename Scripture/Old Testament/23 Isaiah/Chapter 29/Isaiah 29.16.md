[Isaiah 29:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/29?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not?  or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?
