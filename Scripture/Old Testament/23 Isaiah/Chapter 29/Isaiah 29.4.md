[Isaiah 29:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/29?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
