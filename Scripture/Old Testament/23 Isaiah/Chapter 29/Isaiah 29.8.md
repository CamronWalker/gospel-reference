[Isaiah 29:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/29?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
