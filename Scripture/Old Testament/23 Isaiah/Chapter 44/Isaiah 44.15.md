[Isaiah 44:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/44?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
