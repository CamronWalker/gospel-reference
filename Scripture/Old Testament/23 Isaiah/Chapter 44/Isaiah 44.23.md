[Isaiah 44:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/44?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
