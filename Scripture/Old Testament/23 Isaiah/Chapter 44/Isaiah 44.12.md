[Isaiah 44:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/44?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.
