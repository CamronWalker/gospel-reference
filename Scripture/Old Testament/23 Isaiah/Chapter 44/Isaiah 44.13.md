[Isaiah 44:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/44?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
