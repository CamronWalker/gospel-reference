[Isaiah 44:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/44?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination?  shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
