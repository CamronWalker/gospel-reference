[Isaiah 56:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/56?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people.
