[Isaiah 57:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/57?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
