[Isaiah 57:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/57?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
