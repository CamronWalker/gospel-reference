[Isaiah 18:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/18?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Â¶ In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
