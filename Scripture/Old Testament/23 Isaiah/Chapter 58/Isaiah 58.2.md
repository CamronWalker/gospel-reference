[Isaiah 58:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
