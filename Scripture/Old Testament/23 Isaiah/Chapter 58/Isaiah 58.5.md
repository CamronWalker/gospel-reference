[Isaiah 58:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/58?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Is it such a fast that I have chosen?  a day for a man to afflict his soul?  is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him?  wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?
