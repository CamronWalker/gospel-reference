[Isaiah 31:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/31?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) WOE to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!
