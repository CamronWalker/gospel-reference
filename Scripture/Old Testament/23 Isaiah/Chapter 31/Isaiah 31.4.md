[Isaiah 31:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/31?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof.
