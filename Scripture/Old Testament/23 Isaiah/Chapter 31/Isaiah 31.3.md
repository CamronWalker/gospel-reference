[Isaiah 31:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/31?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit.  When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.
