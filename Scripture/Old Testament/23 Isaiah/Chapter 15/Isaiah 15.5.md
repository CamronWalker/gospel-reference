[Isaiah 15:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.
