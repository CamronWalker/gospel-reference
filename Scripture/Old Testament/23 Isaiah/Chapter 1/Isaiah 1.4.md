[Isaiah 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
