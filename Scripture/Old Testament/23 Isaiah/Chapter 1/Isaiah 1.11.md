[Isaiah 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?  saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.
