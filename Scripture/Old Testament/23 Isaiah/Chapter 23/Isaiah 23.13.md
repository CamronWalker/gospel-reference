[Isaiah 23:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/23?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.
