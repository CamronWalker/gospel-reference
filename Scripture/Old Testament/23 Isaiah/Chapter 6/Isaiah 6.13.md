[Isaiah 6:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/6?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Â¶ But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
