[Isaiah 5:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/5?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
