[Isaiah 54:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/54?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
