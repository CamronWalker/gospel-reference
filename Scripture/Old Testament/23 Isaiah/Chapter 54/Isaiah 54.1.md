[Isaiah 54:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/54?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) SING, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the LORD.
