[Isaiah 33:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/33?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) WOE to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee!  when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
