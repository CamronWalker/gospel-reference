[Isaiah 43:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/43?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things?  let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
