[Isaiah 43:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/43?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
