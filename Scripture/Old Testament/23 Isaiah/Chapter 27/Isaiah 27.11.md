[Isaiah 27:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/27?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.
