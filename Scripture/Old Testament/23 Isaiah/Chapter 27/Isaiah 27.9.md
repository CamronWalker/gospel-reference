[Isaiah 27:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/27?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.
