[Isaiah 2:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/2?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
