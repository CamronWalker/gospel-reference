[Isaiah 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.
