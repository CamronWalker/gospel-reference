[Isaiah 63:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/63?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.
