[Isaiah 42:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/42?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight.  These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.
