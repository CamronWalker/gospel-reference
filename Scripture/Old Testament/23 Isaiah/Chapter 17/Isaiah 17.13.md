[Isaiah 17:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/17?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.
