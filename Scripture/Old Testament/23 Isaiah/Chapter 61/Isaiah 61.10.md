[Isaiah 61:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/61?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
