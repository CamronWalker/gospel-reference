[Isaiah 61:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/isa/61?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
