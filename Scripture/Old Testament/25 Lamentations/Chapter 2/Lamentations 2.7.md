[Lamentations 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast.
