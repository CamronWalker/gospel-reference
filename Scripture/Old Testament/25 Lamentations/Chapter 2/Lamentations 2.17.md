[Lamentations 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries.
