[Lamentations 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together.
