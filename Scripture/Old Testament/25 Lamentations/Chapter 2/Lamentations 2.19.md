[Lamentations 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
