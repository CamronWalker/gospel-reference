[Lamentations 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof.
