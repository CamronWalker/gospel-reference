[Lamentations 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) What thing shall I take to witness for thee?  what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?  what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?  for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
