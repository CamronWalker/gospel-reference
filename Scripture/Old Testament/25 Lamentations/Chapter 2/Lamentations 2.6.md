[Lamentations 2:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/2?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
