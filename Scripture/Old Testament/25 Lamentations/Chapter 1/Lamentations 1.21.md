[Lamentations 1:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/1?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me.
