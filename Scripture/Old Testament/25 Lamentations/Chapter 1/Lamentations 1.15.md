[Lamentations 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lam/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.
