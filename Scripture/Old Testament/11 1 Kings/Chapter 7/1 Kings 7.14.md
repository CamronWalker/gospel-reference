[1 Kings 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass.  And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.
