[1 Kings 7:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/7?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.
