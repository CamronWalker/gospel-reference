[1 Kings 22:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
