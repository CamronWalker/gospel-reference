[1 Kings 22:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil.  And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
