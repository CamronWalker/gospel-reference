[1 Kings 22:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
