[1 Kings 22:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am wounded.
