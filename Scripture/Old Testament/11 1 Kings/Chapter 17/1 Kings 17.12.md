[1 Kings 17:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/17?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
