[1 Kings 11:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/11?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
