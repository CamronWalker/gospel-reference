[1 Kings 5:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/5?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
