[1 Kings 5:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/5?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name.
