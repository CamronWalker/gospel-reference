[1 Kings 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
