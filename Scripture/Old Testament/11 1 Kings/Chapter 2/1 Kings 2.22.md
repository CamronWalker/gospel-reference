[1 Kings 2:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?  ask for him the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
