[1 Kings 2:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any wither, that thou shalt surely die?  and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.
