[1 Kings 2:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus saith the king, Come forth.  And he said, Nay; but I will die here.  And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
