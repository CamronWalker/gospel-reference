[1 Kings 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from the LORD.
