[1 Kings 2:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.
