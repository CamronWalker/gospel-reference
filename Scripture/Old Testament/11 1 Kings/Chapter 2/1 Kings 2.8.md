[1 Kings 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
