[1 Kings 9:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/9?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
