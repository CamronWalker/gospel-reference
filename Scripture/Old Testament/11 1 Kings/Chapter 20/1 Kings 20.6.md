[1 Kings 20:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/20?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.
