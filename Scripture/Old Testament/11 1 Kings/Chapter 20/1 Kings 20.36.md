[1 Kings 20:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/20?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.  And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him.
