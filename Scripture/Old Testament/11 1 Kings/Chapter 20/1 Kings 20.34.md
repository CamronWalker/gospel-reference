[1 Kings 20:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/20?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria.  Then said Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant.  So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.
