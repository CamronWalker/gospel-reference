[1 Kings 20:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/20?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And they pitched one over against the other seven days.  And so it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day.
