[1 Kings 20:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/20?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto his servants, Set yourselves in array.  And they set themselves in array against the city.
