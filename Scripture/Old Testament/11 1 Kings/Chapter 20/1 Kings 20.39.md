[1 Kings 20:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/20?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
