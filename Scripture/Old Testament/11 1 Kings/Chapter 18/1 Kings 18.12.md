[1 Kings 18:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
