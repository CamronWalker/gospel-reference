[1 Kings 18:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us.  But there was no voice, nor any that answered.  And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
