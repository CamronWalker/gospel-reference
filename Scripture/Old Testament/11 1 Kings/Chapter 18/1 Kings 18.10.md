[1 Kings 18:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
