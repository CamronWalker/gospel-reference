[1 Kings 18:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand.  And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that the rain stop thee not.
