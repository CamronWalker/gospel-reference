[1 Kings 6:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/6?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
