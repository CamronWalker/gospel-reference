[1 Kings 3:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream.  And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.
