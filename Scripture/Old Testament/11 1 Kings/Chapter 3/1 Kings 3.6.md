[1 Kings 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
