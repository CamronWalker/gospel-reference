[1 Kings 14:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/14?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) ¶ And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah.  Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.  And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
