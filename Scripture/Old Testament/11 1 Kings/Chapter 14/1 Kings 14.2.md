[1 Kings 14:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.
