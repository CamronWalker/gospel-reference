[1 Kings 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
