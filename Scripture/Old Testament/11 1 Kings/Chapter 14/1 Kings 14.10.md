[1 Kings 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.
