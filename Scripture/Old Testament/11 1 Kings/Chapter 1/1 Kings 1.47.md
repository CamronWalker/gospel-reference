[1 Kings 1:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/1?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne.  And the king bowed himself upon the bed.
