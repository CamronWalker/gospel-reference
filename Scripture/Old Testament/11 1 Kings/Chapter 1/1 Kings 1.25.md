[1 Kings 1:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
