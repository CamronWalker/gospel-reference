[1 Kings 8:64](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p64#p64) The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
