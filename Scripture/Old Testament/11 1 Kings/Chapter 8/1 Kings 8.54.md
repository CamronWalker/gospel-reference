[1 Kings 8:54](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p54#p54) And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven.
