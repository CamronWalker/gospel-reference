[1 Kings 8:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
