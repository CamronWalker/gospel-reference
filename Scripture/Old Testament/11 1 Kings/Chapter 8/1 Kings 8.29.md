[1 Kings 8:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place.
