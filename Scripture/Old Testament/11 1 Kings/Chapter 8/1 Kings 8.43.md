[1 Kings 8:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
