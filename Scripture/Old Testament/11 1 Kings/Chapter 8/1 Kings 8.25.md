[1 Kings 8:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me.
