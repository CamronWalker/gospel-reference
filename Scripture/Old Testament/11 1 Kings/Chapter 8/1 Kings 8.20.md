[1 Kings 8:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.
