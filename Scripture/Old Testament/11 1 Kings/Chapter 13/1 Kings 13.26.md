[1 Kings 13:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/13?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.
