[1 Kings 13:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/13?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.  And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
