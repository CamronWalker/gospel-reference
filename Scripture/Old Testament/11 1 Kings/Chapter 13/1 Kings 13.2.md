[1 Kings 13:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/13?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon thee.
