[1 Kings 13:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/13?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water.  But he lied unto him.
