[1 Kings 13:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/13?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of the which the LORD did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
