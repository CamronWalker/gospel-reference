[1 Kings 21:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/21?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king.  Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.
