[1 Kings 21:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/21?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Â¶ And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
