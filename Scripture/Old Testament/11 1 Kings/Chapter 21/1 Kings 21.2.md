[1 Kings 21:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/21?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
