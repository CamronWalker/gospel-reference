[1 Kings 10:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.  So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
