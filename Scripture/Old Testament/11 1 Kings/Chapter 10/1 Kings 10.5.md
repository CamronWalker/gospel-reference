[1 Kings 10:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/10?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
