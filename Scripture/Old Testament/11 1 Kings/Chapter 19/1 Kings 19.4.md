[1 Kings 19:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) ¶ But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.
