[1 Kings 19:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/19?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.
