[1 Kings 12:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/12?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and he offered upon the altar.  So did he in Beth-el, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in Beth-el the priests of the high places which he had made.
