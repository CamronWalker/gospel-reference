[1 Kings 12:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/12?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
