[1 Kings 12:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/12?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
