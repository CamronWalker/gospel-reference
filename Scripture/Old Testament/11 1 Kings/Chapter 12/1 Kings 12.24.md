[1 Kings 12:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-kgs/12?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me.  They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.
