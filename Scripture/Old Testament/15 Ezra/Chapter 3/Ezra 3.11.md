[Ezra 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever toward Israel.  And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.
