[Ezra 7:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him.
