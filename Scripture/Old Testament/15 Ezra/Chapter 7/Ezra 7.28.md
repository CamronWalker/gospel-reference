[Ezra 7:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/7?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes.  And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.
