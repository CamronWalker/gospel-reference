[Ezra 5:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.
