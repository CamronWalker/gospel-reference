[Ezra 6:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/6?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem.  I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.
