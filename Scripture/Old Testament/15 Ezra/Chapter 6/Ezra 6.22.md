[Ezra 6:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/6?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
