[Ezra 9:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/9?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.
