[Ezra 9:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/9?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the people of these abominations?  wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping?
