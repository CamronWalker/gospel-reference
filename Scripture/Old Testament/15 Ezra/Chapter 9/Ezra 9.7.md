[Ezra 9:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
