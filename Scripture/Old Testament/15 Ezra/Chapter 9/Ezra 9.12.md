[Ezra 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.
