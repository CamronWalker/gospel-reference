[Ezra 9:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/9?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our bondage.
