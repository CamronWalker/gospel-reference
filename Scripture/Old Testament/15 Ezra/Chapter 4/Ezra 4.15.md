[Ezra 4:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/4?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.
