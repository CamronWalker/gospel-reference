[Ezra 10:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/ezra/10?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter be turned from us.
