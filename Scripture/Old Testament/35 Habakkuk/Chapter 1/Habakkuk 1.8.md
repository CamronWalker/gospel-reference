[Habakkuk 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.
