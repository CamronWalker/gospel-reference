[Habakkuk 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/hab/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?
