[2 Kings 21:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/21?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
