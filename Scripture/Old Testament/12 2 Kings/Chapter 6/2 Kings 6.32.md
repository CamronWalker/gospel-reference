[2 Kings 6:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head?  look, when the messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?
