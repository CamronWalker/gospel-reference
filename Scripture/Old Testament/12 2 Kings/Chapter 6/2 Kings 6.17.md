[2 Kings 6:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/6?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes, that he may see.  And the LORD opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.
