[2 Kings 6:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/6?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.  And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and, behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.
