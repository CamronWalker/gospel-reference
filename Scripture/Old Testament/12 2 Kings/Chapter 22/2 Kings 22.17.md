[2 Kings 22:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.
