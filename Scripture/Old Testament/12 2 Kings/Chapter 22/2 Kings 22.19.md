[2 Kings 22:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.
