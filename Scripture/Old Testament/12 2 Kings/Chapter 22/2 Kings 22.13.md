[2 Kings 22:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all that which is written concerning us.
