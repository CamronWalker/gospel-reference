[2 Kings 22:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/22?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.  And they brought the king word again.
