[2 Kings 17:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.
