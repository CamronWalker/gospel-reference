[2 Kings 17:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land.
