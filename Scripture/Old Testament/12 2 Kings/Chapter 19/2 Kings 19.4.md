[2 Kings 19:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/19?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left.
