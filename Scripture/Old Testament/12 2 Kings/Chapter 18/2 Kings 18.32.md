[2 Kings 18:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.
