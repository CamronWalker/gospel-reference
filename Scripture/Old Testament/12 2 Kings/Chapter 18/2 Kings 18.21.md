[2 Kings 18:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/18?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.
