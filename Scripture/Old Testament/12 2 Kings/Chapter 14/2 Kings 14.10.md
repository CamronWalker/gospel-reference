[2 Kings 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
