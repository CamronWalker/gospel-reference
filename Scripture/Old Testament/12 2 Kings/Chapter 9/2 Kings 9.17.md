[2 Kings 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company.  And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?
