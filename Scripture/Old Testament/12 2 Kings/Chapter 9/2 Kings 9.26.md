[2 Kings 9:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/9?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD.  Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.
