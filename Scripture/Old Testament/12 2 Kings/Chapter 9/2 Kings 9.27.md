[2 Kings 9:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/9?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Â¶ But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house.  And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot.  And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.  And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.
