[2 Kings 10:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/10?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not.  And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
