[2 Kings 10:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/10?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth.  And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.
