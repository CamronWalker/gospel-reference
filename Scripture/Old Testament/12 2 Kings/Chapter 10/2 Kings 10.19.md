[2 Kings 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting, he shall not live.  But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
