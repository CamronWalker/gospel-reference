[2 Kings 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Beth-el.  And Elisha said unto him, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.  So they went down to Beth-el.
