[2 Kings 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day?  And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.
