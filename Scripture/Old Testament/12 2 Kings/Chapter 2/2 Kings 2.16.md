[2 Kings 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Â¶ And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.  And he said, Ye shall not send.
