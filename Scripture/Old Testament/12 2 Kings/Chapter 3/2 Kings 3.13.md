[2 Kings 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee?  get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother.  And the king of Israel said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.
