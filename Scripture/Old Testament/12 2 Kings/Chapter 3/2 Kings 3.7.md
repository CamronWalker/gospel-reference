[2 Kings 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle?  And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.
