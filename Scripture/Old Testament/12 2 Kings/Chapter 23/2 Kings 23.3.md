[2 Kings 23:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/23?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Â¶ And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book.  And all the people stood to the covenant.
