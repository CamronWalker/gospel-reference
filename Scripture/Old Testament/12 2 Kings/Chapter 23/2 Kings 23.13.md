[2 Kings 23:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/23?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.
