[2 Kings 23:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/23?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither after him arose there any like him.
