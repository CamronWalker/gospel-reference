[2 Kings 23:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/23?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.
