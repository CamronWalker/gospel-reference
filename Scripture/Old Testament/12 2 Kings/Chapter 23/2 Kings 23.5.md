[2 Kings 23:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/23?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
