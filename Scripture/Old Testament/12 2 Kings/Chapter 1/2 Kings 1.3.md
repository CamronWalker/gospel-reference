[2 Kings 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baal-zebub the god of Ekron?
