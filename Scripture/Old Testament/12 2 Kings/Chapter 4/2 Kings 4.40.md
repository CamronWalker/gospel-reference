[2 Kings 4:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/4?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) So they poured out for the men to eat.  And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot.  And they could not eat thereof.
