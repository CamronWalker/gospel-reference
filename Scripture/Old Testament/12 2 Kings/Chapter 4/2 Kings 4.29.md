[2 Kings 4:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/4?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
