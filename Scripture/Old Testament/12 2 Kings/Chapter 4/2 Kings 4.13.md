[2 Kings 4:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee?  wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host?  And she answered, I dwell among mine own people.
