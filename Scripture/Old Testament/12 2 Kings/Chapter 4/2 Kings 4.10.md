[2 Kings 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither.
