[2 Kings 4:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/4?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away.  And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me.
