[2 Kings 11:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/11?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
