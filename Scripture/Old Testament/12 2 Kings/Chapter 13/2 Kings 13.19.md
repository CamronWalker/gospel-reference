[2 Kings 13:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/13?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria but thrice.
