[2 Kings 5:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon thy servant in this thing.
