[2 Kings 5:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents.  And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bare them before him.
