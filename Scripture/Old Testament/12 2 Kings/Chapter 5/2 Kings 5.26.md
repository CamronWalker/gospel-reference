[2 Kings 5:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/5?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee?  Is it a time to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants?
