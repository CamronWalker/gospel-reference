[2 Kings 8:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord?  And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child.
