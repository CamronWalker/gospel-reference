[2 Kings 8:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/8?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.  And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
