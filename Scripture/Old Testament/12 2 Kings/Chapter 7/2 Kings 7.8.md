[2 Kings 7:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it.
