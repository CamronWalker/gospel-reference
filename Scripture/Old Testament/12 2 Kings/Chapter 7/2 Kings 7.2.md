[2 Kings 7:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/7?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be?  And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.
