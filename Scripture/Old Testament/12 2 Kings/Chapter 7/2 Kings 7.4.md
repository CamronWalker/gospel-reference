[2 Kings 7:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/7?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also.  Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
