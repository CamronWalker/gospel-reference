[2 Chronicles 20:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you.
