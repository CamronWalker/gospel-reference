[2 Chronicles 20:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Â¶ And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.
