[2 Chronicles 20:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven?  and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen?  and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee?
