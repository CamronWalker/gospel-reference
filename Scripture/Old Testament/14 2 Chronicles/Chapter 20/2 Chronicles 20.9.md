[2 Chronicles 20:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.
