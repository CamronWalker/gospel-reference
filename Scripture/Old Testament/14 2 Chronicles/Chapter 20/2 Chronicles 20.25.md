[2 Chronicles 20:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/20?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.
