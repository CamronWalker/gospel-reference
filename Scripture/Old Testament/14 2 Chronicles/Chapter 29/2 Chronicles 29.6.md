[2 Chronicles 29:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their backs.
