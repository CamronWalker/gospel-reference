[2 Chronicles 29:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the LORD.  And the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.
