[2 Chronicles 29:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
