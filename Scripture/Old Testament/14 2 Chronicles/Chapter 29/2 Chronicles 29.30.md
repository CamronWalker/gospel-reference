[2 Chronicles 29:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of Asaph the seer.  And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
