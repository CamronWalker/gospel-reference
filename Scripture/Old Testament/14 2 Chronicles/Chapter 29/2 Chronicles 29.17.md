[2 Chronicles 29:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
