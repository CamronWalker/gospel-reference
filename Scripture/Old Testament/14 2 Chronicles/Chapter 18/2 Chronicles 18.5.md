[2 Chronicles 18:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/18?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.
