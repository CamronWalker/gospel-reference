[2 Chronicles 18:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/18?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear?  And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand.
