[2 Chronicles 18:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/18?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace.
