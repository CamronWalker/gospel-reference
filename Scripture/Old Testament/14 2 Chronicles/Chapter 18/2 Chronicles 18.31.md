[2 Chronicles 18:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/18?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.  Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him.
