[2 Chronicles 18:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/18?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.  And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
