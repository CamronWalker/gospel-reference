[2 Chronicles 18:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/18?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
