[2 Chronicles 35:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/35?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place, according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every gate; they might not depart from their service; for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.
