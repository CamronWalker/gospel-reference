[2 Chronicles 35:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/35?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah?  I come not against thee this day, but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is with me, that he destroy thee not.
