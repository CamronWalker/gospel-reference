[2 Chronicles 35:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/35?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers.  And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
