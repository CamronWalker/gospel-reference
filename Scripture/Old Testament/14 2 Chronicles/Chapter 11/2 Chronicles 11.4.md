[2 Chronicles 11:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/11?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing is done of me.  And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and returned from going against Jeroboam.
