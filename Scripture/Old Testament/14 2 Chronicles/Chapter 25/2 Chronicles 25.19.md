[2 Chronicles 25:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/25?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
