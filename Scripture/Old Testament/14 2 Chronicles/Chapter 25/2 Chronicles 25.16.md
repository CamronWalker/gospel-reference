[2 Chronicles 25:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/25?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel?  forbear; why shouldest thou be smitten?  Then the prophet forbare, and said, I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
