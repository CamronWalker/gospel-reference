[2 Chronicles 15:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/15?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.
