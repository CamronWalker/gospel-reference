[2 Chronicles 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like.
