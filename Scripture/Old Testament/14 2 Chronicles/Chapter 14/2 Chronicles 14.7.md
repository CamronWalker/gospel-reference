[2 Chronicles 14:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/14?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side.  So they built and prospered.
