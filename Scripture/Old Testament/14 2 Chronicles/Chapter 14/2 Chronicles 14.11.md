[2 Chronicles 14:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/14?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.  O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.
