[2 Chronicles 14:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/14?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.
