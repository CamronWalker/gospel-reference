[2 Chronicles 10:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/10?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.
