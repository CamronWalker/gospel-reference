[2 Chronicles 10:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/10?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.  But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.
