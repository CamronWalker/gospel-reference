[2 Chronicles 13:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/13?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you.  O children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your fathers; for ye shall not prosper.
