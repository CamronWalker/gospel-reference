[2 Chronicles 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.
