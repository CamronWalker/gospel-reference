[2 Chronicles 9:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/9?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.
