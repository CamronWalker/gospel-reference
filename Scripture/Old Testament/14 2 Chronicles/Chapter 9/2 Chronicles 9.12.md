[2 Chronicles 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto the king.  So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants.
