[2 Chronicles 9:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/9?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
