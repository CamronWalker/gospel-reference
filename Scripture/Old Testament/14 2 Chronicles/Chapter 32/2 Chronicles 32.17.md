[2 Chronicles 32:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/32?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand.
