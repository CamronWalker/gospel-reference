[2 Chronicles 32:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/32?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Â¶ And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of Assyria.  So he returned with shame of face to his own land.  And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword.
