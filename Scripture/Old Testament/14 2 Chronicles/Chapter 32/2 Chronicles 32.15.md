[2 Chronicles 32:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/32?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand?
