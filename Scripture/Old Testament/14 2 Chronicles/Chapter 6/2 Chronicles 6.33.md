[2 Chronicles 6:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/6?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for; that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee, as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which I have built is called by thy name.
