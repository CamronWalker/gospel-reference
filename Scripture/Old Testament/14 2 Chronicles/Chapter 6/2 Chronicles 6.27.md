[2 Chronicles 6:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/6?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
