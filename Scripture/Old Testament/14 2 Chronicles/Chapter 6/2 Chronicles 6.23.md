[2 Chronicles 6:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/6?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
