[2 Chronicles 6:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/6?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.
