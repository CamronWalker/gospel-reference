[2 Chronicles 6:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/6?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place: hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when thou hearest, forgive.
