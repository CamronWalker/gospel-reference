[2 Chronicles 6:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/6?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place.
