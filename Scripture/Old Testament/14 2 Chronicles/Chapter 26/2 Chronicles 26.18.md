[2 Chronicles 26:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/26?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the LORD God.
