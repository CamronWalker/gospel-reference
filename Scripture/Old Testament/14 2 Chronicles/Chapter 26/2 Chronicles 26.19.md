[2 Chronicles 26:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/26?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.
