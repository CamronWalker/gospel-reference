[2 Chronicles 26:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/26?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD had smitten him.
