[2 Chronicles 26:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/26?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.
