[2 Chronicles 23:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/23?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.
