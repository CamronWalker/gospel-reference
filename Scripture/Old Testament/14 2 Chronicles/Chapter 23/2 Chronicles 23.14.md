[2 Chronicles 23:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/23?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain with the sword.  For the priest said, Slay her not in the house of the LORD.
