[2 Chronicles 23:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/23?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses, with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.
