[2 Chronicles 21:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/21?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases.  And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
