[2 Chronicles 21:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/21?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
