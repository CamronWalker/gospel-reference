[2 Chronicles 12:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
