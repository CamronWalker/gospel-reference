[2 Chronicles 12:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/12?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies?  And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
