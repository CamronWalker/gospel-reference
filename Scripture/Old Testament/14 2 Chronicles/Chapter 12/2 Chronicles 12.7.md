[2 Chronicles 12:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/12?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
