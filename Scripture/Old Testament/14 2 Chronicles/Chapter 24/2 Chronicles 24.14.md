[2 Chronicles 24:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/24?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver.  And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
