[2 Chronicles 24:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/24?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.  So they executed judgment against Joash.
