[2 Chronicles 24:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/24?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter.  Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
