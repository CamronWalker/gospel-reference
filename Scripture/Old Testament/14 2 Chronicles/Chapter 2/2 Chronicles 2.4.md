[2 Chronicles 2:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/2?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God.  This is an ordinance for ever to Israel.
