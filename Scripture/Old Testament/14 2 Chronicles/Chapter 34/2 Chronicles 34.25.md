[2 Chronicles 34:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and shall not be quenched.
