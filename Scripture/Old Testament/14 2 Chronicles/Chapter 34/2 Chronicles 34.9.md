[2 Chronicles 34:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.
