[2 Chronicles 34:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the inhabitants of the same.  So they brought the king word again.
