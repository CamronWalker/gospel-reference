[2 Chronicles 34:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.
