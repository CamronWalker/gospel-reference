[2 Chronicles 34:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the LORD their God.  And all his days they departed not from following the LORD, the God of their fathers.
