[2 Chronicles 34:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, when thou heardest his words against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.
