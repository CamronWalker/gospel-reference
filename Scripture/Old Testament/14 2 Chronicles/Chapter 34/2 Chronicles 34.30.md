[2 Chronicles 34:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/34?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.
