[2 Chronicles 30:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/30?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
