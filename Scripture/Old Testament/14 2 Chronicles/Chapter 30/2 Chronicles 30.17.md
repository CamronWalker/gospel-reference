[2 Chronicles 30:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/30?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the LORD.
