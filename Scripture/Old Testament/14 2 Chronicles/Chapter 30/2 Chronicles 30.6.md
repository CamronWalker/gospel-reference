[2 Chronicles 30:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/30?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
