[2 Chronicles 30:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/30?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.
