[2 Chronicles 16:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/16?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him.  Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.
