[2 Chronicles 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
