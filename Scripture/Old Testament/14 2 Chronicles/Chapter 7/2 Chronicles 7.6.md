[2 Chronicles 7:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.
