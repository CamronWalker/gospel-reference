[2 Chronicles 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.
