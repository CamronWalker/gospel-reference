[2 Chronicles 28:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/28?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither: for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.
