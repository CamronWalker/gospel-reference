[2 Chronicles 28:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/28?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
