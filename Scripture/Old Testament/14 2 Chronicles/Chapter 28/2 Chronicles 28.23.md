[2 Chronicles 28:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/28?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them, therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.
