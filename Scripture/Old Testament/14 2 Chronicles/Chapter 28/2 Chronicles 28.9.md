[2 Chronicles 28:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/28?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.
