[2 Chronicles 33:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/33?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.
