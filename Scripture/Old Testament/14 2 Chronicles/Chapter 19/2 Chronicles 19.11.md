[2 Chronicles 19:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/19?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.  Deal courageously, and the LORD shall be with the good.
