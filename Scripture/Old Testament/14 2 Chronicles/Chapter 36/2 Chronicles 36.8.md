[2 Chronicles 36:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-chr/36?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.
