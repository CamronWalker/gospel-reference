[1 Chronicles 23:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/23?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.
