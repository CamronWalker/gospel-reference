[1 Chronicles 5:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/5?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in him.
