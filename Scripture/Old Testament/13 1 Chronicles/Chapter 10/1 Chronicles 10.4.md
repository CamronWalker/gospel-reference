[1 Chronicles 10:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/10?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Then said Saul to his armour-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me.  But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid.  So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.
