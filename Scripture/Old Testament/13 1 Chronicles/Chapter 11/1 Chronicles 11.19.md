[1 Chronicles 11:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/11?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy?  for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it.  Therefore he would not drink it.  These things did these three mightiest.
