[1 Chronicles 14:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/14?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there.  Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
