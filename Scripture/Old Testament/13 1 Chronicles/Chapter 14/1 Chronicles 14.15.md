[1 Chronicles 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
