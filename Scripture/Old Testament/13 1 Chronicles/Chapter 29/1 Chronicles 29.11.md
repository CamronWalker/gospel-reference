[1 Chronicles 29:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.
