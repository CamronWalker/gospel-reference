[1 Chronicles 29:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness.  As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.
