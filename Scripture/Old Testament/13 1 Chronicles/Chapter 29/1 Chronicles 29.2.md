[1 Chronicles 29:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/29?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
