[1 Chronicles 17:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/17?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee.
