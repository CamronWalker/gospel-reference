[1 Chronicles 4:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/4?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for their flocks.
