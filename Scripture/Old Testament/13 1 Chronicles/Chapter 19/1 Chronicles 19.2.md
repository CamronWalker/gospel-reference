[1 Chronicles 19:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/19?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me.  And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father.  So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
