[1 Chronicles 19:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/19?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them.  So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
