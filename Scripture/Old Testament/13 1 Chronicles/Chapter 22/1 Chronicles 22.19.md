[1 Chronicles 22:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/22?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.
