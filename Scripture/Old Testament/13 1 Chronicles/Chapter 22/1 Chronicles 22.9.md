[1 Chronicles 22:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/22?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
