[1 Chronicles 22:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/22?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Is not the LORD your God with you?  and hath he not given you rest on every side?  for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his people.
