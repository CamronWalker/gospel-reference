[1 Chronicles 22:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/22?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
