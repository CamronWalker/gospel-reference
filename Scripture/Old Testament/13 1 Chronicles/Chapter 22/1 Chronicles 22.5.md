[1 Chronicles 22:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/22?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore now make preparation for it.  So David prepared abundantly before his death.
