[1 Chronicles 28:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/28?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment.
