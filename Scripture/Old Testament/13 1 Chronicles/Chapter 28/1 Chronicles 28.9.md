[1 Chronicles 28:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/28?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Â¶ And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.
