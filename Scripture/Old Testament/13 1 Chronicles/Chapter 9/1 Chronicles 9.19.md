[1 Chronicles 9:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/9?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.
