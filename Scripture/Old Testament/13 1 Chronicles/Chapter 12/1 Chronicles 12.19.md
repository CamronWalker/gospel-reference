[1 Chronicles 12:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/12?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy of our heads.
