[1 Chronicles 26:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/26?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers.  In the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead.
