[1 Chronicles 26:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/26?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.
