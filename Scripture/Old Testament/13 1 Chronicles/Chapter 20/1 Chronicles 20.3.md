[1 Chronicles 20:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/20?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes.  Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon.  And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
