[1 Chronicles 21:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/21?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.  Then David and the elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
