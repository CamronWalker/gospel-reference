[1 Chronicles 21:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/1-chr/21?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand.  And the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
