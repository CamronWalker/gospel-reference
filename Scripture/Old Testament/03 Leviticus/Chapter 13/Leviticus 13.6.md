[Leviticus 13:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/13?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
