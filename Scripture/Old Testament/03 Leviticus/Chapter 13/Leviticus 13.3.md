[Leviticus 13:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/13?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.
