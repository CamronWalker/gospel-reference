[Leviticus 13:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/13?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
