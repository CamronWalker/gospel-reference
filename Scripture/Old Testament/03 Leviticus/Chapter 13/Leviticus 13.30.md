[Leviticus 13:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/13?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.
