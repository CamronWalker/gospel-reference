[Leviticus 13:55](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/13?lang=eng&id=p55#p55) And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.
