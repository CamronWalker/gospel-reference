[Leviticus 19:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/19?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Â¶ And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
