[Leviticus 19:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/19?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Â¶ Ye shall keep my statutes.  Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.
