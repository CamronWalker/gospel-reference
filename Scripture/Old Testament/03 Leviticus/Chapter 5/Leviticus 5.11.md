[Leviticus 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Â¶ But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.
