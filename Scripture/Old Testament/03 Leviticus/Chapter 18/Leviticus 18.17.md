[Leviticus 18:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/18?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.
