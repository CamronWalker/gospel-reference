[Leviticus 16:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/16?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
