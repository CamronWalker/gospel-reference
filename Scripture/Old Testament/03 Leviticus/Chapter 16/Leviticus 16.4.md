[Leviticus 16:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/16?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.
