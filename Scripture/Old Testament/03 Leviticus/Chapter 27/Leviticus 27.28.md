[Leviticus 27:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/27?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.
