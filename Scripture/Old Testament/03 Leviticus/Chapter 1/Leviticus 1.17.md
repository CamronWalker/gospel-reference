[Leviticus 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
