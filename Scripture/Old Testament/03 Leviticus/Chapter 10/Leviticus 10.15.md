[Leviticus 10:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/10?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons' with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
