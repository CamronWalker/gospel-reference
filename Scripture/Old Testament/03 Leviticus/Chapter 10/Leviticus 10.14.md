[Leviticus 10:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/10?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
