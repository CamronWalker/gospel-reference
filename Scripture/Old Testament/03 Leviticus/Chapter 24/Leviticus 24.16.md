[Leviticus 24:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/24?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the LORD, shall be put to death.
