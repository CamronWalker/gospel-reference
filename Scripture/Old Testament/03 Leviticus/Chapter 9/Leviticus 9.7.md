[Leviticus 9:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
