[Leviticus 22:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/22?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.
