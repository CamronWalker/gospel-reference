[Leviticus 22:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/22?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
