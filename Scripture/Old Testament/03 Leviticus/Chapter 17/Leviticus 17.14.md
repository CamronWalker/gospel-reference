[Leviticus 17:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/17?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
