[Leviticus 25:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/25?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
