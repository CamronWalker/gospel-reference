[Leviticus 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
