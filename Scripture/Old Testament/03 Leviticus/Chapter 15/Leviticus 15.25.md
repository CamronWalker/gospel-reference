[Leviticus 15:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/15?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.
