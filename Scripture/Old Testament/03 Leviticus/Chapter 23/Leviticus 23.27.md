[Leviticus 23:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
