[Leviticus 23:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Â¶ And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the LORD your God.
