[Leviticus 23:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.
