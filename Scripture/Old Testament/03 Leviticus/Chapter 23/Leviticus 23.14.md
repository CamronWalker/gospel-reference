[Leviticus 23:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/23?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
