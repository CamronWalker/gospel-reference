[Leviticus 4:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/4?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
