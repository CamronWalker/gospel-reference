[Leviticus 26:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/26?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
