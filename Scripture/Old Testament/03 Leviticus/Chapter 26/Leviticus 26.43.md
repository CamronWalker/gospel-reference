[Leviticus 26:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/26?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
