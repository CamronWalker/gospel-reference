[Leviticus 26:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/26?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.
