[Leviticus 26:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/26?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
