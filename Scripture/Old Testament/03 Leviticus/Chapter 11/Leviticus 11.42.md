[Leviticus 11:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/11?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.
