[Leviticus 11:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/11?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.
