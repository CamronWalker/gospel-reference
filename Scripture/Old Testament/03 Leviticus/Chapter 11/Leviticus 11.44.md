[Leviticus 11:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/11?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
