[Leviticus 7:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/7?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
