[Leviticus 7:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/7?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
