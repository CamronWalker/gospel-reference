[Leviticus 14:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.
