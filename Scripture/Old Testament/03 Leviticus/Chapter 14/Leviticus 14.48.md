[Leviticus 14:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/lev/14?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.
