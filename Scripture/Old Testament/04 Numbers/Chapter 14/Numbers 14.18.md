[Numbers 14:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/14?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.
