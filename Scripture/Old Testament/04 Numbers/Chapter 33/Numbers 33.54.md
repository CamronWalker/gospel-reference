[Numbers 33:54](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/33?lang=eng&id=p54#p54) And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
