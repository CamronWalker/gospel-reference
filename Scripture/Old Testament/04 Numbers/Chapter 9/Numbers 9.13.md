[Numbers 9:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/9?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
