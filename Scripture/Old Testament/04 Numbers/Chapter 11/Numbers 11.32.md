[Numbers 11:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
