[Numbers 11:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
