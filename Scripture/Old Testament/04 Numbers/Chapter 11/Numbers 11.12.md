[Numbers 11:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Have I conceived all this people?  have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?
