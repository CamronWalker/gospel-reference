[Numbers 11:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Â¶ And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth.
