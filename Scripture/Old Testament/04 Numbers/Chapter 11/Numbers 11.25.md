[Numbers 11:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.
