[Numbers 11:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat?  for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
