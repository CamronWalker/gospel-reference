[Numbers 11:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/11?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.
