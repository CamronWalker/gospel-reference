[Numbers 16:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/16?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
