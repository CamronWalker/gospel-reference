[Numbers 16:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/16?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.
