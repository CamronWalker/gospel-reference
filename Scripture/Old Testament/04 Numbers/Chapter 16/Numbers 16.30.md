[Numbers 16:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/16?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.
