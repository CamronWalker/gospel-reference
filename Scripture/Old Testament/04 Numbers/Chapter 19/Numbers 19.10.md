[Numbers 19:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/19?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
