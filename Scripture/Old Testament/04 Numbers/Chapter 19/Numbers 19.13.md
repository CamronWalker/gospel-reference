[Numbers 19:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/19?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him.
