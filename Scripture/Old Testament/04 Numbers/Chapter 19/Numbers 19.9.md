[Numbers 19:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/19?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin.
