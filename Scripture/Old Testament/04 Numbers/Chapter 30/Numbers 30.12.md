[Numbers 30:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/30?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
