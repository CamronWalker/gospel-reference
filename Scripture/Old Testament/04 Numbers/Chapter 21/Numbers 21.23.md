[Numbers 21:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/21?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
