[Numbers 21:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/21?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
