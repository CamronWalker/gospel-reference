[Numbers 18:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
