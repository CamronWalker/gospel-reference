[Numbers 18:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
