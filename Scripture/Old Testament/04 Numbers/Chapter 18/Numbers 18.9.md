[Numbers 18:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
