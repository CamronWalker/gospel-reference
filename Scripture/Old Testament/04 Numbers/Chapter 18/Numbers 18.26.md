[Numbers 18:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.
