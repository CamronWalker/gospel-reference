[Numbers 18:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.
