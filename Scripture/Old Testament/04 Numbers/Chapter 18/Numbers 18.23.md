[Numbers 18:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.
