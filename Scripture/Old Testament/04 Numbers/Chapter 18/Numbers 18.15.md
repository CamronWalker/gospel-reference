[Numbers 18:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
