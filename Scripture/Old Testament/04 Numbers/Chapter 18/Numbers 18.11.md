[Numbers 18:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/18?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
