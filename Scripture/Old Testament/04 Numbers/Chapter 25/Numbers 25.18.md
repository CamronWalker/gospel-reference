[Numbers 25:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/25?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.
