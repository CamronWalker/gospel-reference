[Numbers 25:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/25?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.
