[Numbers 20:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/20?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
