[Numbers 20:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/20?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.
