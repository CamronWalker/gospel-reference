[Numbers 6:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/6?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
