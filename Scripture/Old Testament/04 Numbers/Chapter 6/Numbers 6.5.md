[Numbers 6:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
