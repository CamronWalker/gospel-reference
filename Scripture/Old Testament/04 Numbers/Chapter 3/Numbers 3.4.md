[Numbers 3:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.
