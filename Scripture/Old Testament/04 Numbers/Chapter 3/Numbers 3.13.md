[Numbers 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD.
