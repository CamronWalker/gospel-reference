[Numbers 1:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/1?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
