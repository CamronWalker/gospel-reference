[Numbers 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it.
