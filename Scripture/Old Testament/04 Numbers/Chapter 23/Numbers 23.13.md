[Numbers 23:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/23?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
