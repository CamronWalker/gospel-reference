[Numbers 24:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/24?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.
