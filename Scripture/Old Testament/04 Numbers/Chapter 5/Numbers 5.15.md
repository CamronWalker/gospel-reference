[Numbers 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.
