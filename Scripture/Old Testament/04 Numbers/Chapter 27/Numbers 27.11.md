[Numbers 27:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/27?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses.
