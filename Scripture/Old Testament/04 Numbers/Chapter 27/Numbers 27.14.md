[Numbers 27:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/27?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
