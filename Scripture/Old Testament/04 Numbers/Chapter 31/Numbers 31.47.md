[Numbers 31:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/31?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
