[Numbers 31:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/31?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.
