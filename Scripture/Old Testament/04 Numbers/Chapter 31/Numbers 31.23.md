[Numbers 31:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/31?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water.
