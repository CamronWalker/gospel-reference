[Numbers 22:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/22?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.
