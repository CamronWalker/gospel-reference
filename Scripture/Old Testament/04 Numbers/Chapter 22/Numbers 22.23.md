[Numbers 22:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/22?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.
