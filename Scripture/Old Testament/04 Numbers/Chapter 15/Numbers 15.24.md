[Numbers 15:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/15?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.
