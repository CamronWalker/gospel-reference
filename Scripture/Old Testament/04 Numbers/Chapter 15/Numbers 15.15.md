[Numbers 15:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/15?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.
