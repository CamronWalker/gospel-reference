[Numbers 26:62](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/26?lang=eng&id=p62#p62) And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.
