[Numbers 35:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/35?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth.
