[Numbers 35:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/35?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.
