[Numbers 36:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/36?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
