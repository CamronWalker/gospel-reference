[Numbers 32:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/num/32?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
