[Genesis 43:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/43?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
