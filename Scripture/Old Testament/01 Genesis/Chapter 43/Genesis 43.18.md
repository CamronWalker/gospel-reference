[Genesis 43:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/43?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses.
