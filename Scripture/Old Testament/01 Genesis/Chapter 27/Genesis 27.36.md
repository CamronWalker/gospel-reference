[Genesis 27:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/27?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob?  for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing.  And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
