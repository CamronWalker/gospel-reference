[Genesis 41:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/41?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
