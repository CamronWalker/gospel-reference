[Genesis 46:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/46?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
