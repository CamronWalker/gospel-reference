[Genesis 11:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/11?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
