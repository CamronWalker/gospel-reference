[Genesis 30:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/30?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.
