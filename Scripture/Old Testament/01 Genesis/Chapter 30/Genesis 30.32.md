[Genesis 30:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/30?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.
