[Genesis 30:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/30?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband?  and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also?  And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.
