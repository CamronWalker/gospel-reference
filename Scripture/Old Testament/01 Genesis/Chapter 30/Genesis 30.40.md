[Genesis 30:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/30?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto Laban's cattle.
