[Genesis 7:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/7?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.
