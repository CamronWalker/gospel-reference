[Genesis 19:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/19?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And they said, Stand back.  And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them.  And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
