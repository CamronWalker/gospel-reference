[Genesis 19:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/19?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways.  And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
