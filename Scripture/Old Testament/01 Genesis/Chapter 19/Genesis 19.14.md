[Genesis 19:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/19?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city.  But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
