[Genesis 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
