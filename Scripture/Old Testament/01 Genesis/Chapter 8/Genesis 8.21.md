[Genesis 8:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living, as I have done.
