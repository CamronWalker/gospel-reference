[Genesis 31:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/31?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now empty.  God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
