[Genesis 45:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/45?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) THEN Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.  And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
