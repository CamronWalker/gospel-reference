[Genesis 22:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/22?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.
