[Genesis 13:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.
