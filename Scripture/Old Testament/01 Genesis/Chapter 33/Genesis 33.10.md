[Genesis 33:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/33?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and thou wast pleased with me.
