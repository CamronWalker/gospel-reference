[Genesis 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
