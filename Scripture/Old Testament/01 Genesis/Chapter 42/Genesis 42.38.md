[Genesis 42:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/42?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.
