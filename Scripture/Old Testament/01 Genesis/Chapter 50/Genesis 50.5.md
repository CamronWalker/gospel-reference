[Genesis 50:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/50?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.  Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
