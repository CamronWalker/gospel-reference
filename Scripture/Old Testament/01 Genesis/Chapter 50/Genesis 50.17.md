[Genesis 50:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/50?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father.  And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
