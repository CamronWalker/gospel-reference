[Genesis 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
