[Genesis 4:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/4?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.
