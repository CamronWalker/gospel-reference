[Genesis 47:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/47?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land?  buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, that the land be not desolate.
