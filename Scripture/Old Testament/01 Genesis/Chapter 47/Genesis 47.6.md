[Genesis 47:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/47?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
