[Genesis 47:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/47?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
