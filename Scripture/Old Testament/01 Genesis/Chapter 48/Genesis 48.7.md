[Genesis 48:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/48?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Beth-lehem.
