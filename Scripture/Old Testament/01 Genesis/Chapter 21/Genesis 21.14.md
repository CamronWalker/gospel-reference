[Genesis 21:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/21?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
