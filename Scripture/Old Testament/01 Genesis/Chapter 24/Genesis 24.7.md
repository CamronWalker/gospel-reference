[Genesis 24:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/24?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Â¶ The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence.
