[Genesis 34:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/34?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
