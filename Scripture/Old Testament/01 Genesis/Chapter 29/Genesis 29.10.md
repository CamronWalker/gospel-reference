[Genesis 29:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/29?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.
