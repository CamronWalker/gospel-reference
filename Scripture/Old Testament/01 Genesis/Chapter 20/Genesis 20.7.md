[Genesis 20:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/20?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that are thine.
