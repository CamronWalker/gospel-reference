[Genesis 20:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/20?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us?  and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?  thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
