[Genesis 38:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/38?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did.  And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
