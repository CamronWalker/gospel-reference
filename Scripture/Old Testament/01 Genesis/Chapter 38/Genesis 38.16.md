[Genesis 38:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/38?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
