[Genesis 49:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/49?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
