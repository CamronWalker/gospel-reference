[Genesis 44:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/gen/44?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord?  what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?  God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.
