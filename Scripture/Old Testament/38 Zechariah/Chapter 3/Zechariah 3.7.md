[Zechariah 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.
