[Zechariah 3:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.  And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.
