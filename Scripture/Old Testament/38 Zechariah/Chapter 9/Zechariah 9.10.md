[Zechariah 9:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.
