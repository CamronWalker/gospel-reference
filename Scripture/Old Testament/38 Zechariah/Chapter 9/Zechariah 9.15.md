[Zechariah 9:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/9?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.
