[Zechariah 9:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.
