[Zechariah 9:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/9?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
