[Zechariah 12:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/12?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.
