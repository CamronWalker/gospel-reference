[Zechariah 8:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour.
