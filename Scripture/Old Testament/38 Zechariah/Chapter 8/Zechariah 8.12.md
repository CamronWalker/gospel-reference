[Zechariah 8:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things.
