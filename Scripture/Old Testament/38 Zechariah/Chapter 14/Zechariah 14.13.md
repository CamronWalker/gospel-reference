[Zechariah 14:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/14?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour.
