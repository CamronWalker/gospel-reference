[Zechariah 14:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/14?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.
