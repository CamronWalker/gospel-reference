[Zechariah 14:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
