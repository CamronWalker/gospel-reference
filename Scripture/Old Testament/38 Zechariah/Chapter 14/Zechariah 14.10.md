[Zechariah 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.
