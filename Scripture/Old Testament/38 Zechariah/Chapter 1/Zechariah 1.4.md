[Zechariah 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.
