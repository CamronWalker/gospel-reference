[Zechariah 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not.  Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
