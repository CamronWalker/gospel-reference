[Zechariah 13:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/13?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
