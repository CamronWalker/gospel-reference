[Zechariah 13:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/13?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my God.
