[Zechariah 10:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/10?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled, because there was no shepherd.
