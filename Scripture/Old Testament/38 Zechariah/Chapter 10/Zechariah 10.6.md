[Zechariah 10:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/10?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear them.
