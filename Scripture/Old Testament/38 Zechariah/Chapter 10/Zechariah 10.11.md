[Zechariah 10:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/10?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
