[Zechariah 5:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.
