[Zechariah 11:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/11?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces.
