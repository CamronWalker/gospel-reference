[Zechariah 11:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/11?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.
