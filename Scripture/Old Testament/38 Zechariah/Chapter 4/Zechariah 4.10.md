[Zechariah 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/zech/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For who hath despised the day of small things?  for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.
