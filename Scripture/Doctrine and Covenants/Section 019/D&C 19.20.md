[D&C 19:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Wherefore, I command you again to repent, lest I humble you with my almighty power; and that you confess your sins, lest you suffer these punishments of which I have spoken, of which in the smallest, yea, even in the least degree you have tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit.
