[D&C 19:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Therefore I command you to repent--repent, lest I smite you by the rod of my mouth, and by my wrath, and by my anger, and your sufferings be sore--how sore you know not, how exquisite you know not, yea, how hard to bear you know not.
