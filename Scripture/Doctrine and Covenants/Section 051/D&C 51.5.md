[D&C 51:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/51?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And if he shall transgress and is not accounted worthy to belong to the church, he shall not have power to claim that portion which he has consecrated unto the bishop for the poor and needy of my church; therefore, he shall not retain the gift, but shall only have claim on that portion that is deeded unto him.
