[D&C 51:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/51?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And let my servant Edward Partridge, when he shall appoint a man his portion, give unto him a writing that shall secure unto him his portion, that he shall hold it, even this right and this inheritance in the church, until he transgresses and is not accounted worthy by the voice of the church, according to the laws and covenants of the church, to belong to the church.
