[D&C 35:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And whoso shall ask it in my name in faith, they shall cast out devils; they shall heal the sick; they shall cause the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak, and the lame to walk.
