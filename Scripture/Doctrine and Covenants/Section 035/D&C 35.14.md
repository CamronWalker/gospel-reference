[D&C 35:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And their arm shall be my arm, and I will be their shield and their buckler; and I will gird up their loins, and they shall fight manfully for me; and their enemies shall be under their feet; and I will let fall the sword in their behalf, and by the fire of mine indignation will I preserve them.
