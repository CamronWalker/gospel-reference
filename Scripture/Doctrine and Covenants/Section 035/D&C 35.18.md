[D&C 35:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/35?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And I have given unto him the keys of the mystery of those things which have been sealed, even things which were from the foundation of the world, and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming, if he abide in me, and if not, another will I plant in his stead.
