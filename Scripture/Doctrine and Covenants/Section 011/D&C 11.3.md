[D&C 11:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, the field is white already to harvest; therefore, whoso desireth to reap let him thrust in his sickle with his might, and reap while the day lasts, that he may treasure up for his soul everlasting salvation in the kingdom of God.
