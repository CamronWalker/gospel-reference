[D&C 11:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/11?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Seek not to declare my word, but first seek to obtain my word, and then shall your tongue be loosed; then, if you desire, you shall have my Spirit and my word, yea, the power of God unto the convincing of men.
