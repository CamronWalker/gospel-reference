[D&C 104:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Therefore, if any man shall take of the abundance which I have made, and impart not his portion, according to the law of my gospel, unto the poor and the needy, he shall, with the wicked, lift up his eyes in hell, being in torment.
