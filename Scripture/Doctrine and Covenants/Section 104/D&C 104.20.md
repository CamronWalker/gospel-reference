[D&C 104:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Let my servant Sidney Rigdon have appointed unto him the place where he now resides, and the lot of the tannery for his stewardship, for his support while he is laboring in my vineyard, even as I will, when I shall command him.
