[D&C 104:81](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p81#p81) Therefore write speedily to New York and write according to that which shall be dictated by my Spirit; and I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt, that it shall be taken away out of their minds to bring affliction upon you.
