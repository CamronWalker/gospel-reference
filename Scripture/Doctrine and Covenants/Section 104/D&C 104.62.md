[D&C 104:62](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p62#p62) And there shall be a seal upon the treasury, and all the sacred things shall be delivered into the treasury; and no man among you shall call it his own, or any part of it, for it shall belong to you all with one accord.
