[D&C 104:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And all this that the innocent among you may not be condemned with the unjust; and that the guilty among you may not escape; because I, the Lord, have promised unto you a crown of glory at my right hand.
