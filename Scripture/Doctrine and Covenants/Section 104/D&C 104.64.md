[D&C 104:64](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p64#p64) And the avails of the sacred things shall be had in the treasury, and a seal shall be upon it; and it shall not be used or taken out of the treasury by any one, neither shall the seal be loosed which shall be placed upon it, only by the voice of the order, or by commandment.
