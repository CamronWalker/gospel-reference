[D&C 104:80](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p80#p80) And inasmuch as you are diligent and humble, and exercise the prayer of faith, behold, I will soften the hearts of those to whom you are in debt, until I shall send means unto you for your deliverance.
