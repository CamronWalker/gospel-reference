[D&C 104:86](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/104?lang=eng&id=p86#p86) I give unto you this privilege, this once; and behold, if you proceed to do the things which I have laid before you, according to my commandments, all these things are mine, and ye are my stewards, and the master will not suffer his house to be broken up. Even so. Amen.
