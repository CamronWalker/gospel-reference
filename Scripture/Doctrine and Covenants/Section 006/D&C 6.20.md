[D&C 6:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Behold, thou art Oliver, and I have spoken unto thee because of thy desires; therefore treasure up these words in thy heart. Be faithful and diligent in keeping the commandments of God, and I will encircle thee in the arms of my love.
