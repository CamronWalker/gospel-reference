[D&C 6:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Verily, verily, I say unto you, as I said unto my disciples, where two or three are gathered together in my name, as touching one thing, behold, there will I be in the midst of them--even so am I in the midst of you.
