[D&C 6:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And if thou wilt inquire, thou shalt know mysteries which are great and marvelous; therefore thou shalt exercise thy gift, that thou mayest find out mysteries, that thou mayest bring many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, convince them of the error of their ways.
