[D&C 6:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) If thou wilt do good, yea, and hold out faithful to the end, thou shalt be saved in the kingdom of God, which is the greatest of all the gifts of God; for there is no gift greater than the gift of salvation.
