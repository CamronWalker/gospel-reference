[D&C 6:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/6?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And now I command you, that if you have good desires--a desire to lay up treasures for yourself in heaven--then shall you assist in bringing to light, with your gift, those parts of my scriptures which have been hidden because of iniquity.
