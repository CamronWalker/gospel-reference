[D&C 42:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And again, I say unto you, that my servant Edward Partridge shall stand in the office whereunto I have appointed him. And it shall come to pass, that if he transgress another shall be appointed in his stead. Even so. Amen.
