[D&C 42:80](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p80#p80) And if any man or woman shall commit adultery, he or she shall be tried before two elders of the church, or more, and every word shall be established against him or her by two witnesses of the church, and not of the enemy; but if there are more than two witnesses it is better.
