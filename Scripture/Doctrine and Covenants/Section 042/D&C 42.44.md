[D&C 42:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And the elders of the church, two or more, shall be called, and shall pray for and lay their hands upon them in my name; and if they die they shall die unto me, and if they live they shall live unto me.
