[D&C 42:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) For it shall come to pass, that which I spake by the mouths of my prophets shall be fulfilled; for I will consecrate of the riches of those who embrace my gospel among the Gentiles unto the poor of my people who are of the house of Israel.
