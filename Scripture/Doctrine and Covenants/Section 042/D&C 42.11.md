[D&C 42:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Again I say unto you, that it shall not be given to any one to go forth to preach my gospel, or to build up my church, except he be ordained by some one who has authority, and it is known to the church that he has authority and has been regularly ordained by the heads of the church.
