[D&C 42:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And it shall come to pass, that after they are laid before the bishop of my church, and after that he has received these testimonies concerning the consecration of the properties of my church, that they cannot be taken from the church, agreeable to my commandments, every man shall be made accountable unto me, a steward over his own property, or that which he has received by consecration, as much as is sufficient for himself and family.
