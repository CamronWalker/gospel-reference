[D&C 42:61](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/42?lang=eng&id=p61#p61) If thou shalt ask, thou shalt receive revelation upon revelation, knowledge upon knowledge, that thou mayest know the mysteries and peaceable things--that which bringeth joy, that which bringeth life eternal.
