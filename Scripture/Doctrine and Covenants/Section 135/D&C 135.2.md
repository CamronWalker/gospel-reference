[D&C 135:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/135?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only persons in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage manner with four balls, but has since recovered; the latter, through the providence of God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe.
