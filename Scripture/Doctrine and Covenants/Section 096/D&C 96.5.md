[D&C 96:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/96?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For behold, verily I say unto you, this is the most expedient in me, that my word should go forth unto the children of men, for the purpose of subduing the hearts of the children of men for your good. Even so. Amen.
