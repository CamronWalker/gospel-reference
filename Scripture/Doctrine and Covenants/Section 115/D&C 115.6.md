[D&C 115:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/115?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And that the gathering together upon the land of Zion, and upon her stakes, may be for a defense, and for a refuge from the storm, and from wrath when it shall be poured out without mixture upon the whole earth.
