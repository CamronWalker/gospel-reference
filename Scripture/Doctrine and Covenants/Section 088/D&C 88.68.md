[D&C 88:68](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p68#p68) Therefore, sanctify yourselves that your minds become single to God, and the days will come that you shall see him; for he will unveil his face unto you, and it shall be in his own time, and in his own way, and according to his own will.
