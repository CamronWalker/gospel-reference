[D&C 88:87](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p87#p87) For not many days hence and the earth shall tremble and reel to and fro as a drunken man; and the sun shall hide his face, and shall refuse to give light; and the moon shall be bathed in blood; and the stars shall become exceedingly angry, and shall cast themselves down as a fig that falleth from off a fig-tree.
