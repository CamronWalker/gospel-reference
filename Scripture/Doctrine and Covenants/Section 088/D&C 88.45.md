[D&C 88:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.
