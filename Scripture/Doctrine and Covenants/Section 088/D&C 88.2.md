[D&C 88:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Behold, this is pleasing unto your Lord, and the angels rejoice over you; the alms of your prayers have come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, and are recorded in the book of the names of the sanctified, even them of the celestial world.
