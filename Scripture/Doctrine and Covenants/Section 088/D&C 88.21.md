[D&C 88:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And they who are not sanctified through the law which I have given unto you, even the law of Christ, must inherit another kingdom, even that of a terrestrial kingdom, or that of a telestial kingdom.
