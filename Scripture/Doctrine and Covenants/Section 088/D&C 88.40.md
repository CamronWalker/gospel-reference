[D&C 88:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own; justice continueth its course and claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and governeth and executeth all things.
