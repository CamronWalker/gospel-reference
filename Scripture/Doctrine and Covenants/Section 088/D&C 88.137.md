[D&C 88:137](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p137#p137) 7 And ye are called to do this by prayer and thanksgiving, as the Spirit shall give utterance in all your doings in the house of the Lord, in the school of the prophets, that it may become a sanctuary, a tabernacle of the Holy Spirit to your edification.
