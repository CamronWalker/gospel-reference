[D&C 88:99](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p99#p99) And after this another angel shall sound, which is the second trump; and then cometh the redemption of those who are Christ's at his coming; who have received their part in that prison which is prepared for them, that they might receive the gospel, and be judged according to men in the flesh.
