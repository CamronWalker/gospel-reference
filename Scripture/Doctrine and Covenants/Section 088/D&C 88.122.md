[D&C 88:122](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p122#p122) 2 Appoint among yourselves a teacher, and let not all be spokesmen at once; but let one speak at a time and let all listen unto his sayings, that when all have spoken that all may be edified of all, and that every man may have an equal privilege.
