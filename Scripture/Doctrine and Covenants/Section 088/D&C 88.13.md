[D&C 88:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) The light which is in all things, which giveth life to all things, which is the law by which all things are governed, even the power of God who sitteth upon his throne, who is in the bosom of eternity, who is in the midst of all things.
