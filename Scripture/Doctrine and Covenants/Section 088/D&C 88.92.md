[D&C 88:92](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p92#p92) And angels shall fly through the midst of heaven, crying with a loud voice, sounding the trump of God, saying: Prepare ye, prepare ye, O inhabitants of the earth; for the judgment of our God is come. Behold, and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
