[D&C 88:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still.
