[D&C 88:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.
