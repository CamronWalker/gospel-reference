[D&C 88:66](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p66#p66) Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness--in the wilderness, because you cannot see him--my voice, because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound.
