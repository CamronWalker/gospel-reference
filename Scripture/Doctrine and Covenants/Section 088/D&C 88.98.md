[D&C 88:98](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p98#p98) They are Christ's, the first fruits, they who shall descend with him first, and they who are on the earth and in their graves, who are first caught up to meet him; and all this by the voice of the sounding of the trump of the angel of God.
