[D&C 88:104](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p104#p104) 4 And this shall be the sound of his trump, saying to all people, both in heaven and in earth, and that are under the earth--for every ear shall hear it, and every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall confess, while they hear the sound of the trump, saying: Fear God, and give glory to him who sitteth upon the throne, forever and ever; for the hour of his judgment is come.
