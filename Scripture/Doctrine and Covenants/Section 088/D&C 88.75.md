[D&C 88:75](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p75#p75) That I may testify unto your Father, and your God, and my God, that you are clean from the blood of this wicked generation; that I may fulfil this promise, this great and last promise, which I have made unto you, when I will.
