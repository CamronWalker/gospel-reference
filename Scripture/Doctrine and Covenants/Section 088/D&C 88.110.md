[D&C 88:110](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p110#p110) 0 And so on, until the seventh angel shall sound his trump; and he shall stand forth upon the land and upon the sea, and swear in the name of him who sitteth upon the throne, that there shall be time no longer; and Satan shall be bound, that old serpent, who is called the devil, and shall not be loosed for the space of a thousand years.
