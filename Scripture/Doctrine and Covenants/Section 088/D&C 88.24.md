[D&C 88:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And he who cannot abide the law of a telestial kingdom cannot abide a telestial glory; therefore he is not meet for a kingdom of glory. Therefore he must abide a kingdom which is not a kingdom of glory.
