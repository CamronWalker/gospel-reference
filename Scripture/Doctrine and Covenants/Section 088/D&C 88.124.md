[D&C 88:124](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88?lang=eng&id=p124#p124) 4 Cease to be idle; cease to be unclean; cease to find fault one with another; cease to sleep longer than is needful; retire to thy bed early, that ye may not be weary; arise early, that your bodies and your minds may be invigorated.
