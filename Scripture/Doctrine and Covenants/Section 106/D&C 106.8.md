[D&C 106:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/106?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And I will give him grace and assurance wherewith he may stand; and if he continue to be a faithful witness and a light unto the church I have prepared a crown for him in the mansions of my Father. Even so. Amen.
