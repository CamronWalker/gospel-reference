[D&C 84:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And wo unto all those who come not unto this priesthood which ye have received, which I now confirm upon you who are present this day, by mine own voice out of the heavens; and even I have given the heavenly hosts and mine angels charge concerning you.
