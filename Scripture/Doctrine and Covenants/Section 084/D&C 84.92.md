[D&C 84:92](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p92#p92) He that receiveth you not, go away from him alone by yourselves, and cleanse your feet even with water, pure water, whether in heat or in cold, and bear testimony of it unto your Father which is in heaven, and return not again unto that man.
