[D&C 84:88](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p88#p88) And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.
