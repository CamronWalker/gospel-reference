[D&C 84:80](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p80#p80) And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed. And they shall not go hungry, neither athirst.
