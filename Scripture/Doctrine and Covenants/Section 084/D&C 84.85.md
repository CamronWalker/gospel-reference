[D&C 84:85](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p85#p85) Neither take ye thought beforehand what ye shall say; but treasure up in your minds continually the words of life, and it shall be given you in the very hour that portion that shall be meted unto every man.
