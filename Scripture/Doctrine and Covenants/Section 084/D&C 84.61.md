[D&C 84:61](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p61#p61) For I will forgive you of your sins with this commandment--that you remain steadfast in your minds in solemnity and the spirit of prayer, in bearing testimony to all the world of those things which are communicated unto you.
