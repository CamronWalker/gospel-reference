[D&C 84:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house.
