[D&C 84:76](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84?lang=eng&id=p76#p76) But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given--from you it must be preached unto them, that they shall repent of their former evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their evil hearts of unbelief, and your brethren in Zion for their rebellion against you at the time I sent you.
