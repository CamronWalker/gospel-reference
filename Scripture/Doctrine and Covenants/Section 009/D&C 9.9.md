[D&C 9:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.
