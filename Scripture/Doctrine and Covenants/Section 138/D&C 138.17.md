[D&C 138:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy.
