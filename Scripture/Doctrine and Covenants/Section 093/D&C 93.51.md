[D&C 93:51](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p51#p51) Now, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste, and also proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the gospel of salvation, as I shall give him utterance; and by your prayer of faith with one consent I will uphold him.
