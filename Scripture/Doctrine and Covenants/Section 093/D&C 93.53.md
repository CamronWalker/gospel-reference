[D&C 93:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) And, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures, and to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion. Amen.
