[D&C 93:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their place.
