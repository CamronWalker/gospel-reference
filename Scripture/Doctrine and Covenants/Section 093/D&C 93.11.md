[D&C 93:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And I, John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.
