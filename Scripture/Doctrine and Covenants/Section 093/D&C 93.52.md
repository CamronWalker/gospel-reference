[D&C 93:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Frederick G. Williams make haste also, and it shall be given them even according to the prayer of faith; and inasmuch as you keep my sayings you shall not be confounded in this world, nor in the world to come.
