[D&C 10:63](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p63#p63) And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures and do not understand them.
