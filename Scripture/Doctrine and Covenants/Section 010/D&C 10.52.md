[D&C 10:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And now, behold, according to their faith in their prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not bring it to destroy that which they have received, but to build it up.
