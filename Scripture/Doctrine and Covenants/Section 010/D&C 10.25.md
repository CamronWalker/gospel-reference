[D&C 10:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is no harm. And thus he flattereth them, and telleth them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch a man in a lie, that they may destroy him.
