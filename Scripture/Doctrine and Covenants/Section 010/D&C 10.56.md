[D&C 10:56](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p56#p56) But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of the devil--yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.
