[D&C 10:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) For, behold, they shall not accomplish their evil designs in lying against those words. For, behold, if you should bring forth the same words they will say that you have lied and that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted yourself.
