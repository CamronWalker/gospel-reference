[D&C 10:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) But as you cannot always judge the righteous, or as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known unto the world concerning the matter.
