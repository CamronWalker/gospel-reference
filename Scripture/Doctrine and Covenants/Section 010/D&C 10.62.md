[D&C 10:62](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10?lang=eng&id=p62#p62) Yea, and I will also bring to light my gospel which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they shall not deny that which you have received, but they shall build it up, and shall bring to light the true points of my doctrine, yea, and the only doctrine which is in me.
