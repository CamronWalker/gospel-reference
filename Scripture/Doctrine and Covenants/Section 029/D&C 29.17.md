[D&C 29:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it shall come to pass, because of the wickedness of the world, that I will take vengeance upon the wicked, for they will not repent; for the cup of mine indignation is full; for behold, my blood shall not cleanse them if they hear me not.
