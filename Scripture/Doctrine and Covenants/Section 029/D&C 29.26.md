[D&C 29:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) But, behold, verily I say unto you, before the earth shall pass away, Michael, mine archangel, shall sound his trump, and then shall all the dead awake, for their graves shall be opened, and they shall come forth--yea, even all.
