[D&C 29:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) Wherefore, verily I say unto you that all things unto me are spiritual, and not at any time have I given unto you a law which was temporal; neither any man, nor the children of men; neither Adam, your father, whom I created.
