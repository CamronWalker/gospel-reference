[D&C 29:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Behold, I gave unto him that he should be an agent unto himself; and I gave unto him commandment, but no temporal commandment gave I unto him, for my commandments are spiritual; they are not natural nor temporal, neither carnal nor sensual.
