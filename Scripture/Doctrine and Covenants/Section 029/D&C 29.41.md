[D&C 29:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) Wherefore, I, the Lord God, caused that he should be cast out from the Garden of Eden, from my presence, because of his transgression, wherein he became spiritually dead, which is the first death, even that same death which is the last death, which is spiritual, which shall be pronounced upon the wicked when I shall say: Depart, ye cursed.
