[D&C 29:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) For a trump shall sound both long and loud, even as upon Mount Sinai, and all the earth shall quake, and they shall come forth--yea, even the dead which died in me, to receive a crown of righteousness, and to be clothed upon, even as I am, to be with me, that we may be one.
