[D&C 29:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Speaking unto you that you may naturally understand; but unto myself my works have no end, neither beginning; but it is given unto you that ye may understand, because ye have asked it of me and are agreed.
