[D&C 29:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/29?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) But, behold, I say unto you that I, the Lord God, gave unto Adam and unto his seed, that they should not die as to the temporal death, until I, the Lord God, should send forth angels to declare unto them repentance and redemption, through faith on the name of mine Only Begotten Son.
