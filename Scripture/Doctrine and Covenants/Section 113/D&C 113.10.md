[D&C 113:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/113?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) We are to understand that the scattered remnants are exhorted to return to the Lord from whence they have fallen; which if they do, the promise of the Lord is that he will speak to them, or give them revelation. See the 6th, 7th, and 8th verses. The bands of her neck are the curses of God upon her, or the remnants of Israel in their scattered condition among the Gentiles.
