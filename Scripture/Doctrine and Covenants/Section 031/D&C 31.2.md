[D&C 31:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/31?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Behold, you have had many afflictions because of your family; nevertheless, I will bless you and your family, yea, your little ones; and the day cometh that they will believe and know the truth and be one with you in my church.
