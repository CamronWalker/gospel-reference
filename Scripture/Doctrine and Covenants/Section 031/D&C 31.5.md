[D&C 31:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/31?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Therefore, thrust in your sickle with all your soul, and your sins are forgiven you, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your back, for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Wherefore, your family shall live.
