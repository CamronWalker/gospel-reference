[D&C 97:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Verily, verily I say unto you, blessed are such, for they shall obtain; for I, the Lord, show mercy unto all the meek, and upon all whomsoever I will, that I may be justified when I shall bring them unto judgment.
