[D&C 97:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) VERILY I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my voice, even the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth.
