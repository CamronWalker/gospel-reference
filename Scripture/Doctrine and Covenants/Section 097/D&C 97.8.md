[D&C 97:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Verily I say unto you, all among them who know their hearts are honest, and are broken, and their spirits contrite, and are willing to observe their covenants by sacrifice--yea, every sacrifice which I, the Lord, shall command--they are accepted of me.
