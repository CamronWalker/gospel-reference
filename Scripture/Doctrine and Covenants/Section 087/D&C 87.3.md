[D&C 87:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/87?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For behold, the Southern States shall be divided against the Northern States, and the Southern States will call on other nations, even the nation of Great Britain, as it is called, and they shall also call upon other nations, in order to defend themselves against other nations; and then war shall be poured out upon all nations.
