[D&C 82:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Ye call upon my name for revelations, and I give them unto you; and inasmuch as ye keep not my sayings, which I give unto you, ye become transgressors; and justice and judgment are the penalty which is affixed unto my law.
