[D&C 82:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/82?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Nevertheless, there are those among you who have sinned exceedingly; yea, even all of you have sinned; but verily I say unto you, beware from henceforth, and refrain from sin, lest sore judgments fall upon your heads.
