[D&C 27:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of my Spirit, which I will pour out upon you, and my word which I reveal unto you, and be agreed as touching all things whatsoever ye ask of me, and be faithful until I come, and ye shall be caught up, that where I am ye shall be also. Amen.
