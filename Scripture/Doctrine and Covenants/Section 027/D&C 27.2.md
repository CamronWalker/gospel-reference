[D&C 27:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/27?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For, behold, I say unto you, that it mattereth not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink when ye partake of the sacrament, if it so be that ye do it with an eye single to my glory--remembering unto the Father my body which was laid down for you, and my blood which was shed for the remission of your sins.
