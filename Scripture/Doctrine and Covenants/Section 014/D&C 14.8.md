[D&C 14:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it shall come to pass, that if you shall ask the Father in my name, in faith believing, you shall receive the Holy Ghost, which giveth utterance, that you may stand as a witness of the things of which you shall both hear and see, and also that you may declare repentance unto this generation.
