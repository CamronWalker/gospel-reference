[D&C 39:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And inasmuch as my people shall assemble themselves at the Ohio, I have kept in store a blessing such as is not known among the children of men, and it shall be poured forth upon their heads. And from thence men shall go forth into all nations.
