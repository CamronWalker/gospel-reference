[D&C 39:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And if thou do this, I have prepared thee for a greater work. Thou shalt preach the fulness of my gospel, which I have sent forth in these last days, the covenant which I have sent forth to recover my people, which are of the house of Israel.
