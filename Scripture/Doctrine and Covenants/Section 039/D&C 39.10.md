[D&C 39:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But, behold, the days of thy deliverance are come, if thou wilt hearken to my voice, which saith unto thee: Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on my name, and you shall receive my Spirit, and a blessing so great as you never have known.
