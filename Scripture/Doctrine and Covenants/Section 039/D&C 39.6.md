[D&C 39:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/39?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And this is my gospel--repentance and baptism by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost, even the Comforter, which showeth all things, and teacheth the peaceable things of the kingdom.
