[D&C 55:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/55?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And again, you shall be ordained to assist my servant Oliver Cowdery to do the work of printing, and of selecting and writing books for schools in this church, that little children also may receive instruction before me as is pleasing unto me.
