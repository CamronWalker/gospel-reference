[D&C 79:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/79?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) VERILY I say unto you, that it is my will that my servant Jared Carter should go again into the eastern countries, from place to place, and from city to city, in the power of the ordination wherewith he has been ordained, proclaiming glad tidings of great joy, even the everlasting gospel.
