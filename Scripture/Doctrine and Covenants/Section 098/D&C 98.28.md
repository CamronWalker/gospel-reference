[D&C 98:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And now, verily I say unto you, if that enemy shall escape my vengeance, that he be not brought into judgment before me, then ye shall see to it that ye warn him in my name, that he come no more upon you, neither upon your family, even your children's children unto the third and fourth generation.
