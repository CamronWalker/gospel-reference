[D&C 98:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) But if he trespass against thee the fourth time thou shalt not forgive him, but shalt bring these testimonies before the Lord; and they shall not be blotted out until he repent and reward thee four-fold in all things wherewith he has trespassed against thee.
