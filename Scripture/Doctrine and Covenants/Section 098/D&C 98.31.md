[D&C 98:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Nevertheless, thine enemy is in thine hands; and if thou rewardest him according to his works thou art justified; if he has sought thy life, and thy life is endangered by him, thine enemy is in thine hands and thou art justified.
