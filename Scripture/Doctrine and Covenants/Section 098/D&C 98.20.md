[D&C 98:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/98?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) For they do not forsake their sins, and their wicked ways, the pride of their hearts, and their covetousness, and all their detestable things, and observe the words of wisdom and eternal life which I have given unto them.
