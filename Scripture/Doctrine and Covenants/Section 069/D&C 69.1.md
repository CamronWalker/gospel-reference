[D&C 69:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/69?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) HEARKEN unto me, saith the Lord your God, for my servant Oliver Cowdery's sake. It is not wisdom in me that he should be entrusted with the commandments and the moneys which he shall carry unto the land of Zion, except one go with him who will be true and faithful.
