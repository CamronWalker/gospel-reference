[D&C 123:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/123?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) That we may not only publish to all the world, but present them to the heads of government in all their dark and hellish hue, as the last effort which is enjoined on us by our Heavenly Father, before we can fully and completely claim that promise which shall call him forth from his hiding place; and also that the whole nation may be left without excuse before he can send forth the power of his mighty arm.
