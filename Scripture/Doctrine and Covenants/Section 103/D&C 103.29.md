[D&C 103:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his voice in the congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing the churches to keep the commandments which I have given unto them concerning the restoration and redemption of Zion.
