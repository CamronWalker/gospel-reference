[D&C 103:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray earnestly that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the children of Zion upon the laws and commandments which have been and which shall be given unto you.
