[D&C 103:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) It is my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt and my servant Lyman Wight should not return to the land of their brethren, until they have obtained companies to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens, or by twenties, or by fifties, or by an hundred, until they have obtained to the number of five hundred of the strength of my house.
