[D&C 103:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.
