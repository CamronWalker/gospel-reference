[D&C 103:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/103?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, this is the blessing which I have promised after your tribulations, and the tribulations of your brethren--your redemption, and the redemption of your brethren, even their restoration to the land of Zion, to be established, no more to be thrown down.
