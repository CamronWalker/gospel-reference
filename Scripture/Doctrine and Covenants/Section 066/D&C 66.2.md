[D&C 66:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/66?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Verily I say unto you, blessed are you for receiving mine everlasting covenant, even the fulness of my gospel, sent forth unto the children of men, that they might have life and be made partakers of the glories which are to be revealed in the last days, as it was written by the prophets and apostles in days of old.
