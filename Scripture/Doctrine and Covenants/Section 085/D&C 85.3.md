[D&C 85:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/85?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) It is contrary to the will and commandment of God that those who receive not their inheritance by consecration, agreeable to his law, which he has given, that he may tithe his people, to prepare them against the day of vengeance and burning, should have their names enrolled with the people of God.
