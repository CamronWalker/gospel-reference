[D&C 85:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/85?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And all they who are not found written in the book of remembrance shall find none inheritance in that day, but they shall be cut asunder, and their portion shall be appointed them among unbelievers, where are wailing and gnashing of teeth.
