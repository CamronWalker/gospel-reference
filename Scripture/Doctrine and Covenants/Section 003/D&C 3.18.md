[D&C 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled in unbelief because of the iniquity of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, because of their iniquities and their abominations.
