[D&C 3:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.
