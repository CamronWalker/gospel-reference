[D&C 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.
