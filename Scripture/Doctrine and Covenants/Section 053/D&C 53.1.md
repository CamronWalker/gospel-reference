[D&C 53:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/53?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) BEHOLD, I say unto you, my servant Sidney Gilbert, that I have heard your prayers; and you have called upon me that it should be made known unto you, of the Lord your God, concerning your calling and election in the church, which I, the Lord, have raised up in these last days.
