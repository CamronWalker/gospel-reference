[D&C 49:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And my servant Leman shall be ordained unto this work, that he may reason with them, not according to that which he has received of them, but according to that which shall be taught him by you my servants; and by so doing I will bless him, otherwise he shall not prosper.
