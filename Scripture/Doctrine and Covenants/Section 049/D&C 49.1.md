[D&C 49:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) HEARKEN unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold, verily I say unto you, that I give unto you a commandment that you shall go and preach my gospel which ye have received, even as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.
