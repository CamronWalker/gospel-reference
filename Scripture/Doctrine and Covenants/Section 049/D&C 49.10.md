[D&C 49:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And that which I have promised I have so fulfilled, and the nations of the earth shall bow to it; and, if not of themselves, they shall come down, for that which is now exalted of itself shall be laid low of power.
