[D&C 49:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/49?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Wherefore, be not deceived, but continue in steadfastness, looking forth for the heavens to be shaken, and the earth to tremble and to reel to and fro as a drunken man, and for the valleys to be exalted, and for the mountains to be made low, and for the rough places to become smooth--and all this when the angel shall sound his trumpet.
