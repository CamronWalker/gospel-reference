[D&C 62:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/62?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) I, the Lord, am willing, if any among you desire to ride upon horses, or upon mules, or in chariots, he shall receive this blessing, if he receive it from the hand of the Lord, with a thankful heart in all things.
