[D&C 43:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations: Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again.
