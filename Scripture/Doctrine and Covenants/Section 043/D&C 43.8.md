[D&C 43:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.
