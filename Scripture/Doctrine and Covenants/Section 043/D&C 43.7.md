[D&C 43:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.
