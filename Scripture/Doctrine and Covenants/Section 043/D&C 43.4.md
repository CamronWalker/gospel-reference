[D&C 43:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/43?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.
