[D&C 117:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Therefore, let him contend earnestly for the redemption of the First Presidency of my Church, saith the Lord; and when he falls he shall rise again, for his sacrifice shall be more sacred unto me than his increase, saith the Lord.
