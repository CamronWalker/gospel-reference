[D&C 117:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For have I not the fowls of heaven, and also the fish of the sea, and the beasts of the mountains? Have I not made the earth? Do I not hold the destinies of all the armies of the nations of the earth?
