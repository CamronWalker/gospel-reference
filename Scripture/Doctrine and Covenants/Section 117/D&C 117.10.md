[D&C 117:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Let my servant William Marks be faithful over a few things, and he shall be a ruler over many. Let him preside in the midst of my people in the city of Far West, and let him be blessed with the blessings of my people.
