[D&C 117:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/117?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) VERILY thus saith the Lord unto my servant William Marks, and also unto my servant Newel K. Whitney, let them settle up their business speedily and journey from the land of Kirtland, before I, the Lord, send again the snows upon the earth.
