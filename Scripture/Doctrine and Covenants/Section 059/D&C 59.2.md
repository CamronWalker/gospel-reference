[D&C 59:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For those that live shall inherit the earth, and those that die shall rest from all their labors, and their works shall follow them; and they shall receive a crown in the mansions of my Father, which I have prepared for them.
