[D&C 63:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Wherefore, I, the Lord, have said that the fearful, and the unbelieving, and all liars, and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie, and the whoremonger, and the sorcerer, shall have their part in that lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
