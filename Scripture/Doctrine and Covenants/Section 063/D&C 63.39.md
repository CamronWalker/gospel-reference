[D&C 63:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Let my servant Titus Billings, who has the care thereof, dispose of the land, that he may be prepared in the coming spring to take his journey up unto the land of Zion, with those that dwell upon the face thereof, excepting those whom I shall reserve unto myself, that shall not go until I shall command them.
