[D&C 63:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And that every man should take righteousness in his hands and faithfulness upon his loins, and lift a warning voice unto the inhabitants of the earth; and declare both by word and by flight that desolation shall come upon the wicked.
