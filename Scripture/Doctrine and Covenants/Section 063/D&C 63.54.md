[D&C 63:54](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p54#p54) And until that hour there will be foolish virgins among the wise; and at that hour cometh an entire separation of the righteous and the wicked; and in that day will I send mine angels to pluck out the wicked and cast them into unquenchable fire.
