[D&C 63:49](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p49#p49) Yea, and blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, from henceforth, when the Lord shall come, and old things shall pass away, and all things become new, they shall rise from the dead and shall not die after, and shall receive an inheritance before the Lord, in the holy city.
