[D&C 63:64](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p64#p64) Remember that that which cometh from above is sacred, and must be spoken with care, and by constraint of the Spirit; and in this there is no condemnation, and ye receive the Spirit through prayer; wherefore, without this there remaineth condemnation.
