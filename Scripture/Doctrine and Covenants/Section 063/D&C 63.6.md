[D&C 63:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Wherefore, verily I say, let the wicked take heed, and let the rebellious fear and tremble; and let the unbelieving hold their lips, for the day of wrath shall come upon them as a whirlwind, and all flesh shall know that I am God.
