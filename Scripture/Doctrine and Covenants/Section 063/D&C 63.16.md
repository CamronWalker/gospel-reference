[D&C 63:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And verily I say unto you, as I have said before, he that looketh on a woman to lust after her, or if any shall commit adultery in their hearts, they shall not have the Spirit, but shall deny the faith and shall fear.
