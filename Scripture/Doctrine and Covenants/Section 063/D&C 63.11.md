[D&C 63:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/63?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Yea, signs come by faith, unto mighty works, for without faith no man pleaseth God; and with whom God is angry he is not well pleased; wherefore, unto such he showeth no signs, only in wrath unto their condemnation.
