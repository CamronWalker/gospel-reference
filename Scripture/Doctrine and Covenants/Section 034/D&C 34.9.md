[D&C 34:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.
