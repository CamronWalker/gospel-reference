[D&C 45:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And there shall be earthquakes also in divers places, and many desolations; yet men will harden their hearts against me, and they will take up the sword, one against another, and they will kill one another.
