[D&C 45:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not; but unto as many as received me gave I power to do many miracles, and to become the sons of God; and even unto them that believed on my name gave I power to obtain eternal life.
