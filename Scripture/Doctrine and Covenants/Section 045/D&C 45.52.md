[D&C 45:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) Then shall they know that I am the Lord; for I will say unto them: These wounds are the wounds with which I was wounded in the house of my friends. I am he who was lifted up. I am Jesus that was crucified. I am the Son of God.
