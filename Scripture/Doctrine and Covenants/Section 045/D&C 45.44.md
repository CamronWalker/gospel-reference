[D&C 45:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And then they shall look for me, and, behold, I will come; and they shall see me in the clouds of heaven, clothed with power and great glory; with all the holy angels; and he that watches not for me shall be cut off.
