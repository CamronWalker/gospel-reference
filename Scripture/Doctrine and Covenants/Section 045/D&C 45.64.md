[D&C 45:64](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p64#p64) Wherefore I, the Lord, have said, gather ye out from the eastern lands, assemble ye yourselves together ye elders of my church; go ye forth into the western countries, call upon the inhabitants to repent, and inasmuch as they do repent, build up churches unto me.
