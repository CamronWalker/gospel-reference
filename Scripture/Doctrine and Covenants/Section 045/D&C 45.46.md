[D&C 45:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) Wherefore, if ye have slept in peace blessed are you; for as you now behold me and know that I am, even so shall ye come unto me and your souls shall live, and your redemption shall be perfected; and the saints shall come forth from the four quarters of the earth.
