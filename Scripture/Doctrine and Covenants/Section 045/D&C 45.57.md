[D&C 45:57](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p57#p57) For they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived--verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day.
