[D&C 45:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And even so I have sent mine everlasting covenant into the world, to be a light to the world, and to be a standard for my people, and for the Gentiles to seek to it, and to be a messenger before my face to prepare the way before me.
