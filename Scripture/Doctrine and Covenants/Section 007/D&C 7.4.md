[D&C 7:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/7?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And for this cause the Lord said unto Peter: If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? For he desired of me that he might bring souls unto me, but thou desiredst that thou mightest speedily come unto me in my kingdom.
