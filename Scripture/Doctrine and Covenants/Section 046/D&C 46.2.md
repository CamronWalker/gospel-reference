[D&C 46:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) But notwithstanding those things which are written, it always has been given to the elders of my church from the beginning, and ever shall be, to conduct all meetings as they are directed and guided by the Holy Spirit.
