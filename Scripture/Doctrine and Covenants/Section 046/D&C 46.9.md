[D&C 46:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For verily I say unto you, they are given for the benefit of those who love me and keep all my commandments, and him that seeketh so to do; that all may be benefited that seek or that ask of me, that ask and not for a sign that they may consume it upon their lusts.
