[D&C 120:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/120?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) VERILY, thus saith the Lord, the time is now come, that it shall be disposed of by a council, composed of the First Presidency of my Church, and of the bishop and his council, and by my high council; and by mine own voice unto them, saith the Lord. Even so. Amen.
