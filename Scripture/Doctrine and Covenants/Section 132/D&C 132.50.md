[D&C 132:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you. Go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of Abraham of his son Isaac.
