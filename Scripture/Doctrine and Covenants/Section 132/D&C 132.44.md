[D&C 132:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many.
