[D&C 132:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) David's wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.
