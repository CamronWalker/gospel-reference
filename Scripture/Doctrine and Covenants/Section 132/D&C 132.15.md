[D&C 132:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.
