[D&C 132:56](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p56#p56) And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.
