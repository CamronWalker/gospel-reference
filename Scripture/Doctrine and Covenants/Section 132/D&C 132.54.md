[D&C 132:54](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p54#p54) And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.
