[D&C 132:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him.
