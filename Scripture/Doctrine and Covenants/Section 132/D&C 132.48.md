[D&C 132:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on earth, by my word and according to my law, it shall be visited with blessings and not cursings, and with my power, saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth and in heaven.
