[D&C 132:57](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p57#p57) And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.
