[D&C 132:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife. And why did she do it? Because this was the law; and from Hagar sprang many people. This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises.
