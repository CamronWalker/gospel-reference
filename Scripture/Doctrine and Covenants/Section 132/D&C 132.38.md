[D&C 132:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.
