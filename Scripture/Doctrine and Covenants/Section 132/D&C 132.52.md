[D&C 132:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God.
