[D&C 132:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me.
