[D&C 132:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.
