[D&C 132:55](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p55#p55) But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundredfold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.
