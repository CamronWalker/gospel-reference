[D&C 132:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.
