[D&C 132:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.
