[D&C 132:65](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng&id=p65#p65) Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.
