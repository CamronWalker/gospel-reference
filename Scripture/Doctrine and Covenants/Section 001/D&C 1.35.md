[D&C 1:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion.
