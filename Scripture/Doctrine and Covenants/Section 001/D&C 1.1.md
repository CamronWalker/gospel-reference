[D&C 1:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) HEARKEN, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.
