[D&C 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.
