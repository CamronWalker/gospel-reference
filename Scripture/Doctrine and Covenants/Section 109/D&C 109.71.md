[D&C 109:71](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p71#p71) Remember, O Lord, the presidents, even all the presidents of thy church, that thy right hand may exalt them, with all their families, and their immediate connections, that their names may be perpetuated and had in everlasting remembrance from generation to generation.
