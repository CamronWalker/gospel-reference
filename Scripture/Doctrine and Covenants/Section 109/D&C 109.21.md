[D&C 109:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And when thy people transgress, any of them, they may speedily repent and return unto thee, and find favor in thy sight, and be restored to the blessings which thou hast ordained to be poured out upon those who shall reverence thee in thy house.
