[D&C 109:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For thou knowest that we have done this work through great tribulation; and out of our poverty we have given of our substance to build a house to thy name, that the Son of Man might have a place to manifest himself to his people.
