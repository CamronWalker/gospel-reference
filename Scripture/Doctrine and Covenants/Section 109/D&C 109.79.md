[D&C 109:79](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p79#p79) And also this church, to put upon it thy name. And help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!
