[D&C 109:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) Put upon thy servants the testimony of the covenant, that when they go out and proclaim thy word they may seal up the law, and prepare the hearts of thy saints for all those judgments thou art about to send, in thy wrath, upon the inhabitants of the earth, because of their transgressions, that thy people may not faint in the day of trouble.
