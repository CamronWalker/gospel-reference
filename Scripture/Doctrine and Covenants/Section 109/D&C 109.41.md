[D&C 109:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And whatsoever city thy servants shall enter, and the people of that city receive not the testimony of thy servants, and thy servants warn them to save themselves from this untoward generation, let it be upon that city according to that which thou hast spoken by the mouths of thy prophets.
