[D&C 109:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And now we ask thee, Holy Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of thy bosom, in whose name alone salvation can be administered to the children of men, we ask thee, O Lord, to accept of this house, the workmanship of the hands of us, thy servants, which thou didst command us to build.
