[D&C 109:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) We ask thee, Holy Father, to remember those who have been driven by the inhabitants of Jackson county, Missouri, from the lands of their inheritance, and break off, O Lord, this yoke of affliction that has been put upon them.
