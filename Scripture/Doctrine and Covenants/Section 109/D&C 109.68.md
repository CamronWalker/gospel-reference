[D&C 109:68](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p68#p68) O Lord, remember thy servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., and all his afflictions and persecutions--how he has covenanted with Jehovah, and vowed to thee, O Mighty God of Jacob--and the commandments which thou hast given unto him, and that he hath sincerely striven to do thy will.
