[D&C 109:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And that all people who shall enter upon the threshold of the Lord's house may feel thy power, and feel constrained to acknowledge that thou hast sanctified it, and that it is thy house, a place of thy holiness.
