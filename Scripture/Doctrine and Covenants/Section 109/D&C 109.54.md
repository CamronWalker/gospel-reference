[D&C 109:54](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p54#p54) Have mercy, O Lord, upon all the nations of the earth; have mercy upon the rulers of our land; may those principles, which were so honorably and nobly defended, namely, the Constitution of our land, by our fathers, be established forever.
