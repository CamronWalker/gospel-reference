[D&C 109:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And that all their works may be brought to naught, and be swept away by the hail, and by the judgments which thou wilt send upon them in thine anger, that there may be an end to lyings and slanders against thy people.
