[D&C 109:59](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p59#p59) We ask thee to appoint unto Zion other stakes besides this one which thou hast appointed, that the gathering of thy people may roll on in great power and majesty, that thy work may be cut short in righteousness.
