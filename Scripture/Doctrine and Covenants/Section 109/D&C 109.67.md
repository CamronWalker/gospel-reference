[D&C 109:67](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng&id=p67#p67) And may all the scattered remnants of Israel, who have been driven to the ends of the earth, come to a knowledge of the truth, believe in the Messiah, and be redeemed from oppression, and rejoice before thee.
