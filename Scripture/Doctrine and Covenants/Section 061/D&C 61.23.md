[D&C 61:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/61?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And now, concerning my servants, Sidney Rigdon, Joseph Smith, Jun., and Oliver Cowdery, let them come not again upon the waters, save it be upon the canal, while journeying unto their homes; or in other words they shall not come upon the waters to journey, save upon the canal.
