[D&C 8:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Therefore this is thy gift; apply unto it, and blessed art thou, for it shall deliver you out of the hands of your enemies, when, if it were not so, they would slay you and bring your soul to destruction.
