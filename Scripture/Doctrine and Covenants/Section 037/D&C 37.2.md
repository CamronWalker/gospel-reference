[D&C 37:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/37?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And again, I say unto you that ye shall not go until ye have preached my gospel in those parts, and have strengthened up the church whithersoever it is found, and more especially in Colesville; for, behold, they pray unto me in much faith.
