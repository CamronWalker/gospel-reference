[D&C 89:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) That inasmuch as any man drinketh wine or strong drink among you, behold it is not good, neither meet in the sight of your Father, only in assembling yourselves together to offer up your sacraments before him.
