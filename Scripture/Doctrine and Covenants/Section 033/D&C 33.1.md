[D&C 33:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/33?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) BEHOLD, I say unto you, my servants Ezra and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
