[D&C 24:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) BEHOLD, thou wast called and chosen to write the Book of Mormon, and to my ministry; and I have lifted thee up out of thine afflictions, and have counseled thee, that thou hast been delivered from all thine enemies, and thou hast been delivered from the powers of Satan and from darkness!
