[D&C 24:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And at all times, and in all places, he shall open his mouth and declare my gospel as with the voice of a trump, both day and night. And I will give unto him strength such as is not known among men.
