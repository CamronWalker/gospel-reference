[D&C 24:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And in temporal labors thou shalt not have strength, for this is not thy calling. Attend to thy calling and thou shalt have wherewith to magnify thine office, and to expound all scriptures, and continue in laying on of the hands and confirming the churches.
