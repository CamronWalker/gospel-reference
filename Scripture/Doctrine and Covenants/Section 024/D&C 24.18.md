[D&C 24:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And thou shalt take no purse nor scrip, neither staves, neither two coats, for the church shall give unto thee in the very hour what thou needest for food and for raiment, and for shoes and for money, and for scrip.
