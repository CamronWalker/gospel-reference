[D&C 24:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/24?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And in whatsoever place ye shall enter, and they receive you not in my name, ye shall leave a cursing instead of a blessing, by casting off the dust of your feet against them as a testimony, and cleansing your feet by the wayside.
