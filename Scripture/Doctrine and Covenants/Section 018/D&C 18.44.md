[D&C 18:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And by your hands I will work a marvelous work among the children of men, unto the convincing of many of their sins, that they may come unto repentance, and that they may come unto the kingdom of my Father.
