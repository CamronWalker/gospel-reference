[D&C 18:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now, Oliver Cowdery, I speak unto you, and also unto David Whitmer, by the way of commandment; for, behold, I command all men everywhere to repent, and I speak unto you, even as unto Paul mine apostle, for you are called even with that same calling with which he was called.
