[D&C 125:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/125?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And let all those who come from the east, and the west, and the north, and the south, that have desires to dwell therein, take up their inheritance in the same, as well as in the city of Nashville, or in the city of Nauvoo, and in all the stakes which I have appointed, saith the Lord.
