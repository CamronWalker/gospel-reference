[D&C 108:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/108?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Wait patiently until the solemn assembly shall be called of my servants, then you shall be remembered with the first of mine elders, and receive right by ordination with the rest of mine elders whom I have chosen.
