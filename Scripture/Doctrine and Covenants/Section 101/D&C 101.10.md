[D&C 101:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) I have sworn, and the decree hath gone forth by a former commandment which I have given unto you, that I would let fall the sword of mine indignation in behalf of my people; and even as I have said, it shall come to pass.
