[D&C 101:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of Zion.
