[D&C 101:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive-trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard.
