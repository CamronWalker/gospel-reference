[D&C 101:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and--after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof--built the tower also, and set a watchman upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?
