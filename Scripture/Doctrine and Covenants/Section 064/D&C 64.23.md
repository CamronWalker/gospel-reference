[D&C 64:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Behold, now it is called today until the coming of the Son of Man, and verily it is a day of sacrifice, and a day for the tithing of my people; for he that is tithed shall not be burned at his coming.
