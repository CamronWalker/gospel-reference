[D&C 64:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And it is not meet that my servants, Newel K. Whitney and Sidney Gilbert, should sell their store and their possessions here; for this is not wisdom until the residue of the church, which remaineth in this place, shall go up unto the land of Zion.
