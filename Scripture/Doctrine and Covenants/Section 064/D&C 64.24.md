[D&C 64:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For after today cometh the burning--this is speaking after the manner of the Lord--for verily I say, tomorrow all the proud and they that do wickedly shall be as stubble; and I will burn them up, for I am the Lord of Hosts; and I will not spare any that remain in Babylon.
