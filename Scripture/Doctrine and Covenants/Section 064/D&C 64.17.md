[D&C 64:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And also my servant Edward Partridge, behold, he hath sinned, and Satan seeketh to destroy his soul; but when these things are made known unto them, and they repent of the evil, they shall be forgiven.
