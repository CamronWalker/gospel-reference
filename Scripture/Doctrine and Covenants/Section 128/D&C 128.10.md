[D&C 128:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And again, for the precedent, Matthew 16: 18, 19: And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
