[D&C 128:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, as you will find recorded in Revelation 20: 12--And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
