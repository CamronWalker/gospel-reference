[D&C 128:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify. That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder, who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might make a record of a truth before the Lord.
