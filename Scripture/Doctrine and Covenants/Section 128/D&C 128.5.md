[D&C 128:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/128?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world, for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.
