[D&C 5:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And you have a gift to translate the plates; and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; for I will grant unto you no other gift until it is finished.
