[D&C 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.
