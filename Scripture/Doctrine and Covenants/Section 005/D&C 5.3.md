[D&C 5:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And I have caused you that you should enter into a covenant with me, that you should not show them except to those persons to whom I commanded you; and you have no power over them except I grant it unto you.
