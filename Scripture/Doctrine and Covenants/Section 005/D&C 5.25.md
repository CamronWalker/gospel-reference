[D&C 5:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And then he shall say unto the people of this generation: Behold, I have seen the things which the Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know of a surety that they are true, for I have seen them, for they have been shown unto me by the power of God and not of man.
