[D&C 5:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/5?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And now, except he humble himself and acknowledge unto me the things that he has done which are wrong, and covenant with me that he will keep my commandments, and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, he shall have no such views, for I will grant unto him no views of the things of which I have spoken.
