[D&C 86:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/86?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Therefore, let the wheat and the tares grow together until the harvest is fully ripe; then ye shall first gather out the wheat from among the tares, and after the gathering of the wheat, behold and lo, the tares are bound in bundles, and the field remaineth to be burned.
