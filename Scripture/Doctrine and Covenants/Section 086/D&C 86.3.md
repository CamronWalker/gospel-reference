[D&C 86:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/86?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And after they have fallen asleep the great persecutor of the church, the apostate, the whore, even Babylon, that maketh all nations to drink of her cup, in whose hearts the enemy, even Satan, sitteth to reign--behold he soweth the tares; wherefore, the tares choke the wheat and drive the church into the wilderness.
