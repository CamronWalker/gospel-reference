[D&C 44:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/44?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) That your enemies may not have power over you; that you may be preserved in all things; that you may be enabled to keep my laws; that every bond may be broken wherewith the enemy seeketh to destroy my people.
