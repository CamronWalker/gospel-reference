[D&C 67:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch as you strip yourselves from jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me, for ye are not sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and you shall see me and know that I am--not with the carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual.
