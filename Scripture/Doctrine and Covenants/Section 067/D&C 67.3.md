[D&C 67:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/67?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Ye endeavored to believe that ye should receive the blessing which was offered unto you; but behold, verily I say unto you there were fears in your hearts, and verily this is the reason that ye did not receive.
