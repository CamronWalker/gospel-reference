[D&C 119:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall observe this law, or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you.
