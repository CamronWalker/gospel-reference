[D&C 76:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For by my Spirit will I enlighten them, and by my power will I make known unto them the secrets of my will--yea, even those things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor yet entered into the heart of man.
