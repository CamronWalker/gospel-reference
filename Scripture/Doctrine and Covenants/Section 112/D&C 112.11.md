[D&C 112:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) I know thy heart, and have heard thy prayers concerning thy brethren. Be not partial towards them in love above many others, but let thy love be for them as for thyself; and let thy love abound unto all men, and unto all who love my name.
