[D&C 112:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Exalt not yourselves; rebel not against my servant Joseph; for verily I say unto you, I am with him, and my hand shall be over him; and the keys which I have given unto him, and also to youward, shall not be taken from him till I come.
