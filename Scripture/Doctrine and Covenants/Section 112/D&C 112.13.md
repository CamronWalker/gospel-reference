[D&C 112:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And after their temptations, and much tribulation, behold, I, the Lord, will feel after them, and if they harden not their hearts, and stiffen not their necks against me, they shall be converted, and I will heal them.
