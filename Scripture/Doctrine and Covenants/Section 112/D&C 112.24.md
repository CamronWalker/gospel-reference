[D&C 112:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Behold, vengeance cometh speedily upon the inhabitants of the earth, a day of wrath, a day of burning, a day of desolation, of weeping, of mourning, and of lamentation; and as a whirlwind it shall come upon all the face of the earth, saith the Lord.
