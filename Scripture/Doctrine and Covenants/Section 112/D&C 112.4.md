[D&C 112:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/112?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Let thy heart be of good cheer before my face; and thou shalt bear record of my name, not only unto the Gentiles, but also unto the Jews; and thou shalt send forth my word unto the ends of the earth.
