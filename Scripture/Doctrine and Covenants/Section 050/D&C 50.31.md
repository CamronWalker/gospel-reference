[D&C 50:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/50?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Wherefore, it shall come to pass, that if you behold a spirit manifested that you cannot understand, and you receive not that spirit, ye shall ask of the Father in the name of Jesus; and if he give not unto you that spirit, then you may know that it is not of God.
