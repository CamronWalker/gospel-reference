[D&C 90:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For it shall come to pass in that day, that every man shall hear the fulness of the gospel in his own tongue, and in his own language, through those who are ordained unto this power, by the administration of the Comforter, shed forth upon them for the revelation of Jesus Christ.
