[D&C 90:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/90?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Nevertheless, I am not well pleased with many things; and I am not well pleased with my servant William E. McLellin, neither with my servant Sidney Gilbert; and the bishop also, and others have many things to repent of.
