[D&C 136:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) My people must be tried in all things, that they may be prepared to receive the glory that I have for them, even the glory of Zion; and he that will not bear chastisement is not worthy of my kingdom.
