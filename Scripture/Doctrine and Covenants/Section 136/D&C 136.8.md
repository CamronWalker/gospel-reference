[D&C 136:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/136?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Let each company bear an equal proportion, according to the dividend of their property, in taking the poor, the widows, the fatherless, and the families of those who have gone into the army, that the cries of the widow and the fatherless come not up into the ears of the Lord against this people.
