[D&C 30:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And your home shall be at your father's house, until I give unto you further commandments. And you shall attend to the ministry in the church, and before the world, and in the regions round about. Amen.
