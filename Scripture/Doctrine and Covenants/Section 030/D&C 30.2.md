[D&C 30:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/30?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) But your mind has been on the things of the earth more than on the things of me, your Maker, and the ministry whereunto you have been called; and you have not given heed unto my Spirit, and to those who were set over you, but have been persuaded by those whom I have not commanded.
