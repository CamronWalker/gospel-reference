[D&C 60:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And in this place let them lift up their voice and declare my word with loud voices, without wrath or doubting, lifting up holy hands upon them. For I am able to make you holy, and your sins are forgiven you.
