[D&C 60:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And after thou hast come up unto the land of Zion, and hast proclaimed my word, thou shalt speedily return, proclaiming my word among the congregations of the wicked, not in haste, neither in wrath nor with strife.
