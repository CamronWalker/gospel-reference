[D&C 60:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, they have been sent to preach my gospel among the congregations of the wicked; wherefore, I give unto them a commandment, thus: Thou shalt not idle away thy time, neither shalt thou bury thy talent that it may not be known.
