[D&C 60:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/60?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And shake off the dust of thy feet against those who receive thee not, not in their presence, lest thou provoke them, but in secret; and wash thy feet, as a testimony against them in the day of judgment.
