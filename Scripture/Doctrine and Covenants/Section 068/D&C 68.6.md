[D&C 68:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Wherefore, be of good cheer, and do not fear, for I the Lord am with you, and will stand by you; and ye shall bear record of me, even Jesus Christ, that I am the Son of the living God, that I was, that I am, and that I am to come.
