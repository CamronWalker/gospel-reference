[D&C 68:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But, as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices he may officiate in the office of bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power, under the hands of the First Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
