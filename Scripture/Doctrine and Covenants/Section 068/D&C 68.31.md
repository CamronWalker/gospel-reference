[D&C 68:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/68?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Now, I, the Lord, am not well pleased with the inhabitants of Zion, for there are idlers among them; and their children are also growing up in wickedness; they also seek not earnestly the riches of eternity, but their eyes are full of greediness.
