[D&C 133:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Hearken and hear, O ye inhabitants of the earth. Listen, ye elders of my church together, and hear the voice of the Lord; for he calleth upon all men, and he commandeth all men everywhere to repent.
