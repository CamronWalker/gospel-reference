[D&C 133:71](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p71#p71) Behold, and lo, there are none to deliver you; for ye obeyed not my voice when I called to you out of the heavens; ye believed not my servants, and when they were sent unto you ye received them not.
