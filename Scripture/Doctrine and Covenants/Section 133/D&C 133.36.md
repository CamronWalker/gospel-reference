[D&C 133:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And now, verily saith the Lord, that these things might be known among you, O inhabitants of the earth, I have sent forth mine angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel, who hath appeared unto some and hath committed it unto man, who shall appear unto many that dwell on the earth.
