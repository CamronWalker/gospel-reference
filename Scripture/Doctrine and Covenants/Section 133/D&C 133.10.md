[D&C 133:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yea, let the cry go forth among all people: Awake and arise and go forth to meet the Bridegroom; behold and lo, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him. Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord.
