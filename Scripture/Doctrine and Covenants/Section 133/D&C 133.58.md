[D&C 133:58](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p58#p58) To prepare the weak for those things which are coming on the earth, and for the Lord's errand in the day when the weak shall confound the wise, and the little one become a strong nation, and two shall put their tens of thousands to flight.
