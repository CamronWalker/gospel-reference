[D&C 133:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Send forth the elders of my church unto the nations which are afar off; unto the islands of the sea; send forth unto foreign lands; call upon all nations, first upon the Gentiles, and then upon the Jews.
