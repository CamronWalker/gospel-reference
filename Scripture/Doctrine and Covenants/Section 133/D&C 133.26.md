[D&C 133:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And they who are in the north countries shall come in remembrance before the Lord; and their prophets shall hear his voice, and shall no longer stay themselves; and they shall smite the rocks, and the ice shall flow down at their presence.
