[D&C 133:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) For since the beginning of the world have not men heard nor perceived by the ear, neither hath any eye seen, O God, besides thee, how great things thou hast prepared for him that waiteth for thee.
