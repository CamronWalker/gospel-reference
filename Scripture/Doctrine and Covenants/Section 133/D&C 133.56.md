[D&C 133:56](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/133?lang=eng&id=p56#p56) And the graves of the saints shall be opened; and they shall come forth and stand on the right hand of the Lamb, when he shall stand upon Mount Zion, and upon the holy city, the New Jerusalem; and they shall sing the song of the Lamb, day and night forever and ever.
