[D&C 130:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) This earth, in its sanctified and immortal state, will be made like unto crystal and will be a Urim and Thummim to the inhabitants who dwell thereon, whereby all things pertaining to an inferior kingdom, or all kingdoms of a lower order, will be manifest to those who dwell on it; and this earth will be Christ's.
