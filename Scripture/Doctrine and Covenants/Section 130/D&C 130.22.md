[D&C 130:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's; the Son also; but the Holy Ghost has not a body of flesh and bones, but is a personage of Spirit. Were it not so, the Holy Ghost could not dwell in us.
