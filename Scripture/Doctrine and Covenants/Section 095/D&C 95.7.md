[D&C 95:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/95?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And for this cause I gave unto you a commandment that you should call your solemn assembly, that your fastings and your mourning might come up into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth, which is by interpretation, the creator of the first day, the beginning and the end.
