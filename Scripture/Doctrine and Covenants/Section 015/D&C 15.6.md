[D&C 15:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/15?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And now, behold, I say unto you, that the thing which will be of the most worth unto you will be to declare repentance unto this people, that you may bring souls unto me, that you may rest with them in the kingdom of my Father. Amen.
