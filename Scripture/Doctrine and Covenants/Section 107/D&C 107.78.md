[D&C 107:78](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p78#p78) Again, verily, I say unto you, the most important business of the church, and the most difficult cases of the church, inasmuch as there is not satisfaction upon the decision of the bishop or judges, it shall be handed over and carried up unto the council of the church, before the Presidency of the High Priesthood.
