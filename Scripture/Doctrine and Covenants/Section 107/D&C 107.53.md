[D&C 107:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing.
