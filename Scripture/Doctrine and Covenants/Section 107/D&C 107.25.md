[D&C 107:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world--thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.
