[D&C 107:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/107?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power by the hands of the Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.
