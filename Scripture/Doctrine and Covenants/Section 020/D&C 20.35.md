[D&C 20:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And we know that these things are true and according to the revelations of John, neither adding to, nor diminishing from the prophecy of his book, the holy scriptures, or the revelations of God which shall come hereafter by the gift and power of the Holy Ghost, the voice of God, or the ministering of angels.
