[D&C 20:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And we know that all men must repent and believe on the name of Jesus Christ, and worship the Father in his name, and endure in faith on his name to the end, or they cannot be saved in the kingdom of God.
