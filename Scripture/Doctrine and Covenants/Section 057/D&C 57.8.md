[D&C 57:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/57?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And again, verily I say unto you, let my servant Sidney Gilbert plant himself in this place, and establish a store, that he may sell goods without fraud, that he may obtain money to buy lands for the good of the saints, and that he may obtain whatsoever things the disciples may need to plant them in their inheritance.
