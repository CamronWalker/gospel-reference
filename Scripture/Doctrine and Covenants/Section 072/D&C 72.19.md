[D&C 72:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/72?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And now, verily I say unto you, let every elder who shall give an account unto the bishop of the church in this part of the vineyard be recommended by the church or churches, in which he labors, that he may render himself and his accounts approved in all things.
