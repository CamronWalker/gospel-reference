[D&C 124:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And again, verily I say unto you, blessed is my servant Hyrum Smith; for I, the Lord, love him because of the integrity of his heart, and because he loveth that which is right before me, saith the Lord.
