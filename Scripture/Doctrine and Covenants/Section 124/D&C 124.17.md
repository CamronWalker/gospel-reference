[D&C 124:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And for his love he shall be great, for he shall be mine if he do this, saith the Lord. I have seen the work which he hath done, which I accept if he continue, and will crown him with blessings and great glory.
