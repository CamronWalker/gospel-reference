[D&C 124:75](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p75#p75) And let him lift up his voice long and loud, in the midst of the people, to plead the cause of the poor and the needy; and let him not fail, neither let his heart faint; and I will accept of his offerings, for they shall not be unto me as the offerings of Cain, for he shall be mine, saith the Lord.
