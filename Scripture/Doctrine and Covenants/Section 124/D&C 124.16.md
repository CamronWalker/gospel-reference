[D&C 124:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Again, let my servant John C. Bennett help you in your labor in sending my word to the kings and people of the earth, and stand by you, even you my servant Joseph Smith, in the hour of affliction; and his reward shall not fail if he receive counsel.
