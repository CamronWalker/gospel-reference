[D&C 124:97](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p97#p97) Let my servant William Law also receive the keys by which he may ask and receive blessings; let him be humble before me, and be without guile, and he shall receive of my Spirit, even the Comforter, which shall manifest unto him the truth of all things, and shall give him, in the very hour, what he shall say.
