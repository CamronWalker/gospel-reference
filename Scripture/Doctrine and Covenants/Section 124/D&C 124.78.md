[D&C 124:78](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p78#p78) Let my servant Isaac Galland put stock into that house; for I, the Lord, love him for the work he hath done, and will forgive all his sins; therefore, let him be remembered for an interest in that house from generation to generation.
