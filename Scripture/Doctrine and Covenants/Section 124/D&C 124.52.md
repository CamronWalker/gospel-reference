[D&C 124:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And I will answer judgment, wrath, and indignation, wailing, and anguish, and gnashing of teeth upon their heads, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord your God.
