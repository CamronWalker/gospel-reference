[D&C 124:56](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p56#p56) And now I say unto you, as pertaining to my boarding house which I have commanded you to build for the boarding of strangers, let it be built unto my name, and let my name be named upon it, and let my servant Joseph and his house have place therein, from generation to generation.
