[D&C 124:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And again, I say unto you that it is my will that my servant Lyman Wight should continue in preaching for Zion, in the spirit of meekness, confessing me before the world; and I will bear him up as on eagles' wings; and he shall beget glory and honor to himself and unto my name.
