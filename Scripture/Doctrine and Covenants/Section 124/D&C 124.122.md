[D&C 124:122](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p122#p122) 2 And let every man who pays stock bear his proportion of their wages, if it must needs be, for their support, saith the Lord; otherwise, their labors shall be accounted unto them for stock in that house. Even so. Amen.
