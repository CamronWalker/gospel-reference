[D&C 124:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And again, I will visit and soften their hearts, many of them for your good, that ye may find grace in their eyes, that they may come to the light of truth, and the Gentiles to the exaltation or lifting up of Zion.
