[D&C 124:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, I am well pleased with your offering and acknowledgments, which you have made; for unto this end have I raised you up, that I might show forth my wisdom through the weak things of the earth.
