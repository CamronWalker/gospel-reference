[D&C 124:140](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p140#p140) 0 The difference between this quorum and the quorum of elders is that one is to travel continually, and the other is to preside over the churches from time to time; the one has the responsibility of presiding from time to time, and the other has no responsibility of presiding, saith the Lord your God.
