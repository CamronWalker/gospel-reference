[D&C 124:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) For instead of blessings, ye, by your own works, bring cursings, wrath, indignation, and judgments upon your own heads, by your follies, and by all your abominations, which you practise before me, saith the Lord.
