[D&C 124:69](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p69#p69) And if any pay stock into their hands it shall be for stock in that house, for himself, and for his generation after him, from generation to generation, so long as he and his heirs shall hold that stock, and do not sell or convey the stock away out of their hands by their own free will and act, if you will do my will, saith the Lord your God.
