[D&C 124:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And again, verily I say unto you, my servant George Miller is without guile; he may be trusted because of the integrity of his heart; and for the love which he has to my testimony I, the Lord, love him.
