[D&C 124:83](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p83#p83) If he will do my will let him not take his family unto the eastern lands, even unto Kirtland; nevertheless, I, the Lord, will build up Kirtland, but I, the Lord, have a scourge prepared for the inhabitants thereof.
