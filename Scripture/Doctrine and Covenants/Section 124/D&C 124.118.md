[D&C 124:118](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p118#p118) 8 And hearken unto the counsel of my servants Joseph, and Hyrum, and William Law, and unto the authorities which I have called to lay the foundation of Zion; and it shall be well with him forever and ever. Even so. Amen.
