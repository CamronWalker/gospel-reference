[D&C 124:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) And the iniquity and transgression of my holy laws and commandments I will visit upon the heads of those who hindered my work, unto the third and fourth generation, so long as they repent not, and hate me, saith the Lord God.
