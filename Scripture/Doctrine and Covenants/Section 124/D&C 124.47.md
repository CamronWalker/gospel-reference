[D&C 124:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) And it shall come to pass that if you build a house unto my name, and do not do the things that I say, I will not perform the oath which I make unto you, neither fulfil the promises which ye expect at my hands, saith the Lord.
