[D&C 124:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Your prayers are acceptable before me; and in answer to them I say unto you, that you are now called immediately to make a solemn proclamation of my gospel, and of this stake which I have planted to be a cornerstone of Zion, which shall be polished with the refinement which is after the similitude of a palace.
