[D&C 124:76](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p76#p76) Let his family rejoice and turn away their hearts from affliction; for I have chosen him and anointed him, and he shall be honored in the midst of his house, for I will forgive all his sins, saith the Lord. Amen.
