[D&C 124:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) This house shall be a healthful habitation if it be built unto my name, and if the governor which shall be appointed unto it shall not suffer any pollution to come upon it. It shall be holy, or the Lord your God will not dwell therein.
