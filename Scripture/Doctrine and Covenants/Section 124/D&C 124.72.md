[D&C 124:72](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p72#p72) Verily I say unto you, let my servant Joseph pay stock into their hands for the building of that house, as seemeth him good; but my servant Joseph cannot pay over fifteen thousand dollars stock in that house, nor under fifty dollars; neither can any other man, saith the Lord.
