[D&C 124:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) That when he shall finish his work I may receive him unto myself, even as I did my servant David Patten, who is with me at this time, and also my servant Edward Partridge, and also my aged servant Joseph Smith, Sen., who sitteth with Abraham at his right hand, and blessed and holy is he, for he is mine.
