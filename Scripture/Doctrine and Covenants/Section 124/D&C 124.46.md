[D&C 124:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) But if they will not hearken to my voice, nor unto the voice of these men whom I have appointed, they shall not be blest, because they pollute mine holy grounds, and mine holy ordinances, and charters, and my holy words which I give unto them.
