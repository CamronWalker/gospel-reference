[D&C 124:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) But behold, at the end of this appointment your baptisms for your dead shall not be acceptable unto me; and if you do not these things at the end of the appointment ye shall be rejected as a church, with your dead, saith the Lord your God.
