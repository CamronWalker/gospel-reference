[D&C 124:87](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p87#p87) Therefore, let my servant William put his trust in me, and cease to fear concerning his family, because of the sickness of the land. If ye love me, keep my commandments; and the sickness of the land shall redound to your glory.
