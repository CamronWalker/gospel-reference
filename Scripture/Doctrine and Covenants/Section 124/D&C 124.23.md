[D&C 124:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it shall be for a house for boarding, a house that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein; therefore let it be a good house, worthy of all acceptation, that the weary traveler may find health and safety while he shall contemplate the word of the Lord; and the corner-stone I have appointed for Zion.
