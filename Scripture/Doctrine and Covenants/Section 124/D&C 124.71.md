[D&C 124:71](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p71#p71) And if they do appropriate any portion of that stock anywhere else, only in that house, without the consent of the stockholder, and do not repay fourfold for the stock which they appropriate anywhere else, only in that house, they shall be accursed, and shall be moved out of their place, saith the Lord God; for I, the Lord, am God, and cannot be mocked in any of these things.
