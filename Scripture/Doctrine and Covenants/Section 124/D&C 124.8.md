[D&C 124:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/124?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And that I may visit them in the day of visitation, when I shall unveil the face of my covering, to appoint the portion of the oppressor among hypocrites, where there is gnashing of teeth, if they reject my servants and my testimony which I have revealed unto them.
