[D&C 56:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Wo unto you rich men, that will not give your substance to the poor, for your riches will canker your souls; and this shall be your lamentation in the day of visitation, and of judgment, and of indignation: The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and my soul is not saved!
