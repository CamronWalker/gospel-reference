[D&C 56:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Wherefore, I revoke the commandment which was given unto my servants Thomas B. Marsh and Ezra Thayre, and give a new commandment unto my servant Thomas, that he shall take up his journey speedily to the land of Missouri, and my servant Selah J. Griffin shall also go with him.
