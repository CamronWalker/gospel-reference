[D&C 56:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold, thus saith the Lord unto my people--you have many things to do and to repent of; for behold, your sins have come up unto me, and are not pardoned, because you seek to counsel in your own ways.
