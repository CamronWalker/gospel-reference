[D&C 56:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Wo unto you poor men, whose hearts are not broken, whose spirits are not contrite, and whose bellies are not satisfied, and whose hands are not stayed from laying hold upon other men's goods, whose eyes are full of greediness, and who will not labor with your own hands!
