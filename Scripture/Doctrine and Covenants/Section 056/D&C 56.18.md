[D&C 56:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/56?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But blessed are the poor who are pure in heart, whose hearts are broken, and whose spirits are contrite, for they shall see the kingdom of God coming in power and great glory unto their deliverance; for the fatness of the earth shall be theirs.
