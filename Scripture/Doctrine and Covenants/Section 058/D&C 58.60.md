[D&C 58:60](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58?lang=eng&id=p60#p60) Let that which has been bestowed upon Ziba Peterson be taken from him; and let him stand as a member in the church, and labor with his own hands, with the brethren, until he is sufficiently chastened for all his sins; for he confesseth them not, and he thinketh to hide them.
