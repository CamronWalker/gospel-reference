[D&C 58:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And after that cometh the day of my power; then shall the poor, the lame, and the blind, and the deaf, come in unto the marriage of the Lamb, and partake of the supper of the Lord, prepared for the great day to come.
