[D&C 58:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And now, verily, I say concerning the residue of the elders of my church, the time has not yet come, for many years, for them to receive their inheritance in this land, except they desire it through the prayer of faith, only as it shall be appointed unto them of the Lord.
