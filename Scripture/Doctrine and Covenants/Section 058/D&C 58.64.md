[D&C 58:64](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58?lang=eng&id=p64#p64) For, verily, the sound must go forth from this place into all the world, and unto the uttermost parts of the earth--the gospel must be preached unto every creature, with signs following them that believe.
