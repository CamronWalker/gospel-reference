[D&C 118:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/118?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Let the residue continue to preach from that hour, and if they will do this in all lowliness of heart, in meekness and humility, and long-suffering, I, the Lord, give unto them a promise that I will provide for their families; and an effectual door shall be opened for them, from henceforth.
