[D&C 122:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And although their influence shall cast thee into trouble, and into bars and walls, thou shalt be had in honor; and but for a small moment and thy voice shall be more terrible in the midst of thine enemies than the fierce lion, because of thy righteousness; and thy God shall stand by thee forever and ever.
