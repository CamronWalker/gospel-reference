[D&C 122:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Therefore, hold on thy way, and the priesthood shall remain with thee; for their bounds are set, they cannot pass. Thy days are known, and thy years shall not be numbered less; therefore, fear not what man can do, for God shall be with you forever and ever.
