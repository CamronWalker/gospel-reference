[D&C 21:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Yea, his weeping for Zion I have seen, and I will cause that he shall mourn for her no longer; for his days of rejoicing are come unto the remission of his sins, and the manifestations of my blessings upon his works.
