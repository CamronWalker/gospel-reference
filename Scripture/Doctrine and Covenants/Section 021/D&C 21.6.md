[D&C 21:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For by doing these things the gates of hell shall not prevail against you; yea, and the Lord God will disperse the powers of darkness from before you, and cause the heavens to shake for your good, and his name's glory.
