[D&C 21:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/21?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For, behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing, and they shall believe on his words, which are given him through me by the Comforter, which manifesteth that Jesus was crucified by sinful men for the sins of the world, yea, for the remission of sins unto the contrite heart.
