[D&C 65:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/65?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) HEARKEN, and lo, a voice as of one sent down from on high, who is mighty and powerful, whose going forth is unto the ends of the earth, yea, whose voice is unto men--Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
