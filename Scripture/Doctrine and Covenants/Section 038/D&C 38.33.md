[D&C 38:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And from thence, whosoever I will shall go forth among all nations, and it shall be told them what they shall do; for I have a great work laid up in store, for Israel shall be saved, and I will lead them whithersoever I will, and no power shall stay my hand.
