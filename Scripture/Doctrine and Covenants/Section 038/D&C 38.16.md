[D&C 38:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And for your salvation I give unto you a commandment, for I have heard your prayers, and the poor have complained before me, and the rich have I made, and all flesh is mine, and I am no respecter of persons.
