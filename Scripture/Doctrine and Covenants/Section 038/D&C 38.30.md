[D&C 38:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms, lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.
