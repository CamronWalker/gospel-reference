[D&C 38:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And if ye seek the riches which it is the will of the Father to give unto you, ye shall be the richest of all people, for ye shall have the riches of eternity; and it must needs be that the riches of the earth are mine to give; but beware of pride, lest ye become as the Nephites of old.
