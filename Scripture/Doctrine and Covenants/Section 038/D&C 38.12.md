[D&C 38:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Which causeth silence to reign, and all eternity is pained, and the angels are waiting the great command to reap down the earth, to gather the tares that they may be burned; and, behold, the enemy is combined.
