[D&C 38:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But now I tell it unto you, and ye are blessed, not because of your iniquity, neither your hearts of unbelief; for verily some of you are guilty before me, but I will be merciful unto your weakness.
