[D&C 38:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And again, I say unto you, I give unto you a commandment, that every man, both elder, priest, teacher, and also member, go to with his might, with the labor of his hands, to prepare and accomplish the things which I have commanded.
