[D&C 38:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) I am the same which have taken the Zion of Enoch into mine own bosom; and verily, I say, even as many as have believed in my name, for I am Christ, and in mine own name, by the virtue of the blood which I have spilt, have I pleaded before the Father for them.
