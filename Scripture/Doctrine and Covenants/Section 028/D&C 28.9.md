[D&C 28:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/28?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now, behold, I say unto you that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the city Zion shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you that it shall be on the borders by the Lamanites.
