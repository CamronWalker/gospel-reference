[D&C 28:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/28?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now, behold, I say unto you that you shall go unto the Lamanites and preach my gospel unto them; and inasmuch as they receive thy teachings thou shalt cause my church to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by way of commandment.
