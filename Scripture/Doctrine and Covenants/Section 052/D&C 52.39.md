[D&C 52:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/52?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Let the residue of the elders watch over the churches, and declare the word in the regions round about them; and let them labor with their own hands that there be no idolatry nor wickedness practised.
