[D&C 75:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it shall be more tolerable for the heathen in the day of judgment, than for that house; therefore, gird up your loins and be faithful, and ye shall overcome all things, and be lifted up at the last day. Even so. Amen.
