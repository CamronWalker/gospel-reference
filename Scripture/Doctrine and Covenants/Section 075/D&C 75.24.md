[D&C 75:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/75?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Behold, I say unto you, that it is the duty of the church to assist in supporting the families of those, and also to support the families of those who are called and must needs be sent unto the world to proclaim the gospel unto the world.
