[D&C 134:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.
