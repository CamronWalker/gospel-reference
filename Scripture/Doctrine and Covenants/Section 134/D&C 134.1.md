[D&C 134:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) WE believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.
