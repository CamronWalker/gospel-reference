[D&C 134:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.
