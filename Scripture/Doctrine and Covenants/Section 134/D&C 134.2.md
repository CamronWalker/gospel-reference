[D&C 134:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/134?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life.
