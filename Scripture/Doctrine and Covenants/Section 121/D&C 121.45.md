[D&C 121:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) Let thy bowels also be full of charity towards all men, and to the household of faith, and let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God; and the doctrine of the priesthood shall distil upon thy soul as the dews from heaven.
