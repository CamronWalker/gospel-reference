[D&C 121:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) According to that which was ordained in the midst of the Council of the Eternal God of all other gods before this world was, that should be reserved unto the finishing and the end thereof, when every man shall enter into his eternal presence and into his immortal rest.
