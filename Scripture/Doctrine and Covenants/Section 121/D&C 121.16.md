[D&C 121:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Cursed are all those that shall lift up the heel against mine anointed, saith the Lord, and cry they have sinned when they have not sinned before me, saith the Lord, but have done that which was meet in mine eyes, and which I commanded them.
