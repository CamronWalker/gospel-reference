[D&C 121:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) How long can rolling waters remain impure? What power shall stay the heavens? As well might man stretch forth his puny arm to stop the Missouri river in its decreed course, or to turn it up stream, as to hinder the Almighty from pouring down knowledge from heaven upon the heads of the Latter-day Saints.
