[D&C 105:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And let all my people who dwell in the regions round about be very faithful, and prayerful, and humble before me, and reveal not the things which I have revealed unto them, until it is wisdom in me that they should be revealed.
