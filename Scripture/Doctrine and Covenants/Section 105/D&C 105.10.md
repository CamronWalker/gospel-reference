[D&C 105:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) That they themselves may be prepared, and that my people may be taught more perfectly, and have experience, and know more perfectly concerning their duty, and the things which I require at their hands.
