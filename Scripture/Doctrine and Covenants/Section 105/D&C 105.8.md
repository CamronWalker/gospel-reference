[D&C 105:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) But I speak concerning my churches abroad--there are many who will say: Where is their God? Behold, he will deliver them in time of trouble, otherwise we will not go up unto Zion, and will keep our moneys.
