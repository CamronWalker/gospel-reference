[D&C 23:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/23?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, I speak unto you, Hyrum, a few words; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy heart is opened, and thy tongue loosed; and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church continually. Wherefore thy duty is unto the church forever, and this because of thy family. Amen.
