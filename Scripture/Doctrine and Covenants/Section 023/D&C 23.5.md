[D&C 23:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/23?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Joseph; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy calling also is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church; and this is thy duty from henceforth and forever. Amen.
