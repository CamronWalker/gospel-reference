[D&C 23:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/23?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Behold, I speak a few words unto you, Samuel; for thou also art under no condemnation, and thy calling is to exhortation, and to strengthen the church; and thou art not as yet called to preach before the world. Amen.
