[Words of Mormon 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until they have fallen into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth. And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.
