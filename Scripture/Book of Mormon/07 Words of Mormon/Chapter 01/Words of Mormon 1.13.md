[Words of Mormon 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people. But behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his own arm, with the sword of Laban.
