[Words of Mormon 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/w-of-m/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.
