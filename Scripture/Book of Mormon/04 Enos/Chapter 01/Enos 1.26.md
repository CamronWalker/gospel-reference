[Enos 1:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it above that of the world.
