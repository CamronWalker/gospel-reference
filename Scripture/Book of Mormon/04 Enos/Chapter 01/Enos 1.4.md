[Enos 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.
