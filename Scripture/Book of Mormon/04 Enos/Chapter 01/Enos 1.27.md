[Enos 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest. And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father. Amen.
