[Enos 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.
