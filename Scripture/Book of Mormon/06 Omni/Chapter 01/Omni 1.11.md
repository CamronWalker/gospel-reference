[Omni 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/omni/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And behold, the record of this people is engraven upon plates which is had by the kings, according to the generations; and I know of no revelation save that which has been written, neither prophecy; wherefore, that which is sufficient is written. And I make an end.
