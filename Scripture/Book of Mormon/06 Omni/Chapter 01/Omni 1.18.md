[Omni 1:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/omni/1?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But it came to pass that Mosiah caused that they should be taught in his language. And it came to pass that after they were taught in the language of Mosiah, Zarahemla gave a genealogy of his fathers, according to his memory; and they are written, but not in these plates.
