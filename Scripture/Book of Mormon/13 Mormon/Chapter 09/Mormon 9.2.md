[Mormon 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Behold, will ye believe in the day of your visitation--behold, when the Lord shall come, yea, even that great day when the earth shall be rolled together as a scroll, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, yea, in that great day when ye shall be brought to stand before the Lamb of God--then will ye say that there is no God?
