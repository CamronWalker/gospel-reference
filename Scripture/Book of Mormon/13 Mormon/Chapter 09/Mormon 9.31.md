[Mormon 9:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father, because of his imperfection, neither them who have written before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.
