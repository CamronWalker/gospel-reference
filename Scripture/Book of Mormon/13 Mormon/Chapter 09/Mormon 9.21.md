[Mormon 9:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ it shall be granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends of the earth.
