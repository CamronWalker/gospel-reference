[Mormon 9:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And these signs shall follow them that believe--in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover;
