[Mormon 9:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.
