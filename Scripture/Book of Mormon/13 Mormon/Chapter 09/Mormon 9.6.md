[Mormon 9:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) O then ye unbelieving, turn ye unto the Lord; cry mightily unto the Father in the name of Jesus, that perhaps ye may be found spotless, pure, fair, and white, having been cleansed by the blood of the Lamb, at that great and last day.
