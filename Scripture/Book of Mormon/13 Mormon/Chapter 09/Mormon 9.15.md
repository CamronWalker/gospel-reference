[Mormon 9:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things passed, of which I have spoken? Has the end come yet? Behold I say unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of miracles.
