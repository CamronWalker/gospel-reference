[Mormon 9:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no imperfection in our record.
