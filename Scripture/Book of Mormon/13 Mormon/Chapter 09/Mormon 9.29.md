[Mormon 9:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all things in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in nowise be cast out.
