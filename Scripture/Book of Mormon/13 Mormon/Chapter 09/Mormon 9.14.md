[Mormon 9:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And then cometh the judgment of the Holy One upon them; and then cometh the time that he that is filthy shall be filthy still; and he that is righteous shall be righteous still; he that is happy shall be happy still; and he that is unhappy shall be unhappy still.
