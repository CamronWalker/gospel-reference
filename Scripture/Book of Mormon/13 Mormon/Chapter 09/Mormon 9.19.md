[Mormon 9:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased to be a God of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being? And behold, I say unto you he changeth not; if so he would cease to be God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles.
