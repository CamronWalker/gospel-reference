[Mormon 9:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.
