[Mormon 9:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and also that none other people knoweth our language; and because that none other people knoweth our language, therefore he hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof.
