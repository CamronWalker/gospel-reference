[Mormon 9:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be answered according to their faith; and may God the Father remember the covenant which he hath made with the house of Israel; and may he bless them forever, through faith on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
