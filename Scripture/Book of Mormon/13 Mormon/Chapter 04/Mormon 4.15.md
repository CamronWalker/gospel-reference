[Mormon 4:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/4?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and seventh year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had sacrificed their women and their children, that they did go against the Lamanites with exceedingly great anger, insomuch that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive them out of their lands.
