[Mormon 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back again to the land of Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.
