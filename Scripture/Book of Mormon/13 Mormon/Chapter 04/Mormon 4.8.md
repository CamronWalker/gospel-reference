[Mormon 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the Nephites. And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the Lamanites they did again boast of their own strength; and they went forth in their own might, and took possession again of the city Desolation.
