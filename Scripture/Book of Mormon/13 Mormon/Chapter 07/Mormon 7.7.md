[Mormon 7:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/7?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And he hath brought to pass the redemption of the world, whereby he that is found guiltless before him at the judgment day hath it given unto him to dwell in the presence of God in his kingdom, to sing ceaseless praises with the choirs above, unto the Father, and unto the Son, and unto the Holy Ghost, which are one God, in a state of happiness which hath no end.
