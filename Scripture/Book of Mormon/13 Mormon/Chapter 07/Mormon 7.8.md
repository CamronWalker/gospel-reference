[Mormon 7:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Therefore repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus, and lay hold upon the gospel of Christ, which shall be set before you, not only in this record but also in the record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews, which record shall come from the Gentiles unto you.
