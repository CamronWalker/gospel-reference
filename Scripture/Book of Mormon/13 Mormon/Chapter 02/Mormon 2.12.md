[Mormon 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that they would again become a righteous people.
