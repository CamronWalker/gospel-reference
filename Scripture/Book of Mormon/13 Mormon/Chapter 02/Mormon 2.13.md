[Mormon 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin.
