[Mormon 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, both temporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the land. And thus three hundred and forty and four years had passed away.
