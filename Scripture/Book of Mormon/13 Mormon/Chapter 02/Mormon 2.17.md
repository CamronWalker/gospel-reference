[Mormon 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron.
