[Mormon 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that they did flee from before us.
