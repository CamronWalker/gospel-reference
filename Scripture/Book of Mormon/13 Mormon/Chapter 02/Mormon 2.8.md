[Mormon 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with Lamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all the face of the land.
