[Mormon 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for behold they had wilfully rebelled against their God; and the beloved disciples were taken away out of the land, because of their iniquity.
