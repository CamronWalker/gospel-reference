[Mormon 3:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/3?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, which ye shall have among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall have other witness besides him whom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very Christ and the very God.
