[Mormon 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and first year the Lamanites did come down to the city of Desolation to battle against us; and it came to pass that in that year we did beat them, insomuch that they did return to their own lands again.
