[Mormon 6:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) O that ye had repented before this great destruction had come upon you. But behold, ye are gone, and the Father, yea, the Eternal Father of heaven, knoweth your state; and he doeth with you according to his justice and mercy.
