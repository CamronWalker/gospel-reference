[Mormon 6:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And I, Mormon, wrote an epistle unto the king of the Lamanites, and desired of him that he would grant unto us that we might gather together our people unto the land of Cumorah, by a hill which was called Cumorah, and there we could give them battle.
