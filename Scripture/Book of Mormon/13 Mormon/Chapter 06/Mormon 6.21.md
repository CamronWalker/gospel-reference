[Mormon 6:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And the day soon cometh that your mortal must put on immortality, and these bodies which are now moldering in corruption must soon become incorruptible bodies; and then ye must stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to be judged according to your works; and if it so be that ye are righteous, then are ye blessed with your fathers who have gone before you.
