[Mormon 6:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/6?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that my people, with their wives and their children, did now behold the armies of the Lamanites marching towards them; and with that awful fear of death which fills the breasts of all the wicked, did they await to receive them.
