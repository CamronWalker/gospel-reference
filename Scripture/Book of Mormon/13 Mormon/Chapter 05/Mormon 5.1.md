[Mormon 5:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did repent of the oath which I had made that I would no more assist them; and they gave me command again of their armies, for they looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their afflictions.
