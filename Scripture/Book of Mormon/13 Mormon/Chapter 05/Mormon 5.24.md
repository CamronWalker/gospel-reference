[Mormon 5:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Therefore, repent ye, and humble yourselves before him, lest he shall come out in justice against you--lest a remnant of the seed of Jacob shall go forth among you as a lion, and tear you in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
