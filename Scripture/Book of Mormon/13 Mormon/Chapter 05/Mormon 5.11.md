[Mormon 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For I know that such will sorrow for the calamity of the house of Israel; yea, they will sorrow for the destruction of this people; they will sorrow that this people had not repented that they might have been clasped in the arms of Jesus.
