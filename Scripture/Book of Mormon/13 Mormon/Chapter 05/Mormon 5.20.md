[Mormon 5:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) But behold, it shall come to pass that they shall be driven and scattered by the Gentiles; and after they have been driven and scattered by the Gentiles, behold, then will the Lord remember the covenant which he made unto Abraham and unto all the house of Israel.
