[Mormon 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And also that the seed of this people may more fully believe his gospel, which shall go forth unto them from the Gentiles; for this people shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people, beyond the description of that which ever hath been amongst us, yea, even that which hath been among the Lamanites, and this because of their unbelief and idolatry.
