[Mormon 5:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/5?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Now these things are written unto the remnant of the house of Jacob; and they are written after this manner, because it is known of God that wickedness will not bring them forth unto them; and they are to be hid up unto the Lord that they may come forth in his own due time.
