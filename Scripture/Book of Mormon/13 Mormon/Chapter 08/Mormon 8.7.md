[Mormon 8:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And behold, the Lamanites have hunted my people, the Nephites, down from city to city and from place to place, even until they are no more; and great has been their fall; yea, great and marvelous is the destruction of my people, the Nephites.
