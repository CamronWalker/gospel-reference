[Mormon 8:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And I know that ye do walk in the pride of your hearts; and there are none save a few only who do not lift themselves up in the pride of their hearts, unto the wearing of very fine apparel, unto envying, and strifes, and malice, and persecutions, and all manner of iniquities; and your churches, yea, even every one, have become polluted because of the pride of your hearts.
