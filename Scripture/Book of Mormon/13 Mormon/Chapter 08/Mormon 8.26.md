[Mormon 8:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And no one need say they shall not come, for they surely shall, for the Lord hath spoken it; for out of the earth shall they come, by the hand of the Lord, and none can stay it; and it shall come in a day when it shall be said that miracles are done away; and it shall come even as if one should speak from the dead.
