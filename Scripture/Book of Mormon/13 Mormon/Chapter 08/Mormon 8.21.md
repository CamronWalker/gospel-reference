[Mormon 8:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he that shall breathe out wrath and strifes against the work of the Lord, and against the covenant people of the Lord who are the house of Israel, and shall say: We will destroy the work of the Lord, and the Lord will not remember his covenant which he hath made unto the house of Israel--the same is in danger to be hewn down and cast into the fire;
