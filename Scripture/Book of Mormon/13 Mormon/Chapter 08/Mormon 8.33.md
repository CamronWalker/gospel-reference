[Mormon 8:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls? Behold, look ye unto the revelations of God; for behold, the time cometh at that day when all these things must be fulfilled.
