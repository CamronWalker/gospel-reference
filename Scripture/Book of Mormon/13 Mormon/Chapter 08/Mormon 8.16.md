[Mormon 8:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And blessed be he that shall bring this thing to light; for it shall be brought out of darkness unto light, according to the word of God; yea, it shall be brought out of the earth, and it shall shine forth out of darkness, and come unto the knowledge of the people; and it shall be done by the power of God.
