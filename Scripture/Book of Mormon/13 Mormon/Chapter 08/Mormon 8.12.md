[Mormon 8:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And whoso receiveth this record, and shall not condemn it because of the imperfections which are in it, the same shall know of greater things than these. Behold, I am Moroni; and were it possible, I would make all things known unto you.
