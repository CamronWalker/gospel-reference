[Mormon 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And if there be faults they be the faults of a man. But behold, we know no fault; nevertheless God knoweth all things; therefore, he that condemneth, let him be aware lest he shall be in danger of hell fire.
