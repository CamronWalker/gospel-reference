[Mormon 8:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And I am the same who hideth up this record unto the Lord; the plates thereof are of no worth, because of the commandment of the Lord. For he truly saith that no one shall have them to get gain; but the record thereof is of great worth; and whoso shall bring it to light, him will the Lord bless.
