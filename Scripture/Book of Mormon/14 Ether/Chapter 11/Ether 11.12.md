[Ether 11:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/11?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that in the days of Ethem there came many prophets, and prophesied again unto the people; yea, they did prophesy that the Lord would utterly destroy them from off the face of the earth except they repented of their iniquities.
