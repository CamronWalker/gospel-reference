[Ether 11:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/11?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that there arose a rebellion among the people, because of that secret combination which was built up to get power and gain; and there arose a mighty man among them in iniquity, and gave battle unto Moron, in which he did overthrow the half of the kingdom; and he did maintain the half of the kingdom for many years.
