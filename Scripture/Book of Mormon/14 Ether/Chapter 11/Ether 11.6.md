[Ether 11:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/11?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And there was great calamity in all the land, for they had testified that a great curse should come upon the land, and also upon the people, and that there should be a great destruction among them, such an one as never had been upon the face of the earth, and their bones should become as heaps of earth upon the face of the land except they should repent of their wickedness.
