[Ether 11:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/11?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And they hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord, because of their wicked combinations; wherefore, there began to be wars and contentions in all the land, and also many famines and pestilences, insomuch that there was a great destruction, such an one as never had been known upon the face of the earth; and all this came to pass in the days of Shiblom.
