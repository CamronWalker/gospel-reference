[Ether 9:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) But the people believed not the words of the prophets, but they cast them out; and some of them they cast into pits and left them to perish. And it came to pass that they did all these things according to the commandment of the king, Heth.
