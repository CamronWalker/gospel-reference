[Ether 9:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that Coriantum did walk in the steps of his father, and did build many mighty cities, and did administer that which was good unto his people in all his days. And it came to pass that he had no children even until he was exceedingly old.
