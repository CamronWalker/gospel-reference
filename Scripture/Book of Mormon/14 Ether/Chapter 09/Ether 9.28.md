[Ether 9:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And there came prophets in the land again, crying repentance unto them--that they must prepare the way of the Lord or there should come a curse upon the face of the land; yea, even there should be a great famine, in which they should be destroyed if they did not repent.
