[Ether 9:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And it came to pass that the Lord did cause the serpents that they should pursue them no more, but that they should hedge up the way that the people could not pass, that whoso should attempt to pass might fall by the poisonous serpents.
