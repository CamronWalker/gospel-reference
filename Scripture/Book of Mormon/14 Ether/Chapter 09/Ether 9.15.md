[Ether 9:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And after that he had anointed Emer to be king he saw peace in the land for the space of two years, and he died, having seen exceedingly many days, which were full of sorrow. And it came to pass that Emer did reign in his stead, and did fill the steps of his father.
