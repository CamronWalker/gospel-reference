[Ether 13:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his household, neither the people; and the wars ceased not; and they sought to kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again in the cavity of the rock.
