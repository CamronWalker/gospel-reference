[Ether 13:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the face thereof;
