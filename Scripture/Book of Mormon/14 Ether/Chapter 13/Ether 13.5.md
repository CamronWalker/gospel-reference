[Ether 13:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come--after it should be destroyed it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord; wherefore, it could not be a new Jerusalem for it had been in a time of old; but it should be built up again, and become a holy city of the Lord; and it should be built unto the house of Israel.
