[Ether 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made with their father, Abraham.
