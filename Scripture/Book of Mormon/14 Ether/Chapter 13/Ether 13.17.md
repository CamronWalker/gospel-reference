[Ether 13:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of the fair sons and daughters upon the face of the whole earth who repented of their sins.
