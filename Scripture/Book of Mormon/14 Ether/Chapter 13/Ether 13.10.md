[Ether 13:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose garments are white through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of Israel.
