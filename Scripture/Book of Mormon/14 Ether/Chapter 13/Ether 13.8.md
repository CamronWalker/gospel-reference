[Ether 13:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the end come when the earth shall pass away.
