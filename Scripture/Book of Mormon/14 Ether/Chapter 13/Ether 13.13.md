[Ether 13:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people.
