[Ether 6:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.
