[Ether 6:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their king. And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to be their king.
