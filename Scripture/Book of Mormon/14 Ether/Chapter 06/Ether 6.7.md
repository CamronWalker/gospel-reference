[Ether 6:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.
