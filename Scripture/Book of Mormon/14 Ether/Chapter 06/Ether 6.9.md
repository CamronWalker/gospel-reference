[Ether 6:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.
