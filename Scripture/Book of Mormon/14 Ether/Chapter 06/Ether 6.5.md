[Ether 6:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.
