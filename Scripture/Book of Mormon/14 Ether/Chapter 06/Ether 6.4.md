[Ether 6:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of food, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal or fowl that they should carry with them--and it came to pass that when they had done all these things they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God.
