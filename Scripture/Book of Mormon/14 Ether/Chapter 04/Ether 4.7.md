[Ether 4:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them are.
