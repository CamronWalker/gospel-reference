[Ether 4:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and believe in my gospel, and be baptized in my name; for he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned; and signs shall follow them that believe in my name.
