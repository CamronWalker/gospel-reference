[Ether 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed; and he that shall deny these things, let him be accursed; for unto them will I show no greater things, saith Jesus Christ; for I am he who speaketh.
