[Ether 4:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto his people.
