[Ether 4:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have written them. And he commanded me that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord.
