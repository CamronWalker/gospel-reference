[Ether 10:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that Levi did serve in captivity after the death of his father, for the space of forty and two years. And he did make war against the king of the land, by which he did obtain unto himself the kingdom.
