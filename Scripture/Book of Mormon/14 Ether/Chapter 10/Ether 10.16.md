[Ether 10:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And after he had obtained unto himself the kingdom he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord; and the people did prosper in the land; and he did live to a good old age, and begat sons and daughters; and he also begat Corom, whom he anointed king in his stead.
