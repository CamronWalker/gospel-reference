[Ether 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that Lib also did that which was good in the sight of the Lord. And in the days of Lib the poisonous serpents were destroyed. Wherefore they did go into the land southward, to hunt food for the people of the land, for the land was covered with animals of the forest. And Lib also himself became a great hunter.
