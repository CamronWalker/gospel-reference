[Ether 10:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And it came to pass that Hearthom reigned in the stead of his father. And when Hearthom had reigned twenty and four years, behold, the kingdom was taken away from him. And he served many years in captivity, yea, even all the remainder of his days.
