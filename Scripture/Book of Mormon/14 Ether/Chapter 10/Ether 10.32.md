[Ether 10:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And it came to pass that Com drew away the half of the kingdom. And he reigned over the half of the kingdom forty and two years; and he went to battle against the king, Amgid, and they fought for the space of many years, during which time Com gained power over Amgid, and obtained power over the remainder of the kingdom.
