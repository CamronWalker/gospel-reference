[Ether 10:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that Corom did that which was good in the sight of the Lord all his days; and he begat many sons and daughters; and after he had seen many days he did pass away, even like unto the rest of the earth; and Kish reigned in his stead.
