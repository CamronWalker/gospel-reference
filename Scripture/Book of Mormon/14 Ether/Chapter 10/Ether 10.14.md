[Ether 10:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And his brother did rise up in rebellion against him, by which he did bring him into captivity; and he did remain in captivity all his days; and he begat sons and daughters in captivity, and in his old age he begat Levi; and he died.
