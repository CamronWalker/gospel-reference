[Ether 10:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that Riplakish did not do that which was right in the sight of the Lord, for he did have many wives and concubines, and did lay that upon men's shoulders which was grievous to be borne; yea, he did tax them with heavy taxes; and with the taxes he did build many spacious buildings.
