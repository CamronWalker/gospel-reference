[Ether 10:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that Shez did remember the destruction of his fathers, and he did build up a righteous kingdom; for he remembered what the Lord had done in bringing Jared and his brother across the deep; and he did walk in the ways of the Lord; and he begat sons and daughters.
