[Ether 10:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And Morianton did live to an exceedingly great age, and then he begat Kim; and Kim did reign in the stead of his father; and he did reign eight years, and his father died. And it came to pass that Kim did not reign in righteousness, wherefore he was not favored of the Lord.
