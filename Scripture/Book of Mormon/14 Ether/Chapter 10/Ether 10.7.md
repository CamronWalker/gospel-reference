[Ether 10:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/10?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Wherefore he did obtain all his fine work, yea, even his fine gold he did cause to be refined in prison; and all manner of fine workmanship he did cause to be wrought in prison. And it came to pass that he did afflict the people with his whoredoms and abominations.
