[Ether 7:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land. And it came to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in his old age.
