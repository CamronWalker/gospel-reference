[Ether 7:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out of the hill, and made swords out of steel for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to the city Nehor and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it unto his father Kib.
