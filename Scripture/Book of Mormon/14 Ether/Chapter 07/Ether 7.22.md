[Ether 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his desires.
