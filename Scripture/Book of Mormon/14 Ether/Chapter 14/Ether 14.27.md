[Ether 14:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz that the people began to be frightened, and began to flee before the armies of Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that would not join them.
