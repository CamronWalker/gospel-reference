[Ether 14:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left to bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of blood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the worms of the flesh.
