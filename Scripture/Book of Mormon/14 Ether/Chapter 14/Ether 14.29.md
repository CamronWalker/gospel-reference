[Ether 14:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven again; and they came the second time, and they were driven again the second time. And it came to pass that they came again the third time, and the battle became exceedingly sore.
