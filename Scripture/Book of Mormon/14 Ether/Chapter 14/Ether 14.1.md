[Ether 14:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now there began to be a great curse upon all the land because of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land.
