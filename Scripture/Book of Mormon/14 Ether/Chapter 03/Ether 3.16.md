[Ether 3:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.
