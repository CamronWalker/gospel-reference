[Ether 3:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would believe in him that he could show unto him all things--it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.
