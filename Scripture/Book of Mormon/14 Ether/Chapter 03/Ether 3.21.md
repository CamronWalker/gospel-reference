[Ether 3:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the time cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall treasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.
