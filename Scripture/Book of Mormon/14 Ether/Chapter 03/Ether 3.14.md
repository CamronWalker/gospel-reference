[Ether 3:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.
