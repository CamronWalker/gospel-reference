[Ether 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.
