[Ether 3:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.
