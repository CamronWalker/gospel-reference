[Ether 3:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.
