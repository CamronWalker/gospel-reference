[Ether 15:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) Now the last words which are written by Ether are these: Whether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.
