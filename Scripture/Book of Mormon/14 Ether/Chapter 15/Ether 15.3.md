[Ether 15:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted.
