[Ether 15:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their camps they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air exceedingly.
