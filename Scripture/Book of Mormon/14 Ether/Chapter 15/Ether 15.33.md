[Ether 15:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth. And he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished his record; (and the hundredth part I have not written) and he hid them in a manner that the people of Limhi did find them.
