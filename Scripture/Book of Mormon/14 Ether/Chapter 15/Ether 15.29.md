[Ether 15:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Wherefore, he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did overtake them; and they fought again with the sword. And it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with the loss of blood.
