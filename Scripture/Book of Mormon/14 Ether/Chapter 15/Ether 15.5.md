[Ether 15:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle he wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself up, that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would spare the lives of the people.
