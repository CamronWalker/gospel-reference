[Ether 15:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they conquered not, and when the night came again they did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.
