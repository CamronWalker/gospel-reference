[Ether 15:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.
