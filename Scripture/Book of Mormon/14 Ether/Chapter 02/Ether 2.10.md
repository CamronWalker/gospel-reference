[Ether 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off.
