[Ether 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God--that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done.
