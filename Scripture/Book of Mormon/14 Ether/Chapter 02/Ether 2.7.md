[Ether 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people.
