[Ether 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel.
