[Ether 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?
