[Ether 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them.
