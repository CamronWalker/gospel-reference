[Ether 2:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire.
