[Ether 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity.
