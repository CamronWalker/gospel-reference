[Ether 2:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth.
