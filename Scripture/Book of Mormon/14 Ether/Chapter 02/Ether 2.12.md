[Ether 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written.
