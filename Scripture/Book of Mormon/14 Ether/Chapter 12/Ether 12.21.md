[Ether 12:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.
