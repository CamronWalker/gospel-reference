[Ether 12:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.
