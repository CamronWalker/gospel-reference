[Ether 12:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) For it was by faith that Christ showed himself unto our fathers, after he had risen from the dead; and he showed not himself unto them until after they had faith in him; wherefore, it must needs be that some had faith in him, for he showed himself not unto the world.
