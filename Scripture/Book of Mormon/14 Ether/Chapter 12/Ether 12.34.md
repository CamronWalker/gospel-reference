[Ether 12:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; wherefore, except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father.
