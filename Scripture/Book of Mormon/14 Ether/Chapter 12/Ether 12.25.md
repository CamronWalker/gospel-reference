[Ether 12:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words.
