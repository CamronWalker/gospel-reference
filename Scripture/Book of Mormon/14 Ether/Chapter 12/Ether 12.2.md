[Ether 12:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Ether was a prophet of the Lord; wherefore Ether came forth in the days of Coriantumr, and began to prophesy unto the people, for he could not be restrained because of the Spirit of the Lord which was in him.
