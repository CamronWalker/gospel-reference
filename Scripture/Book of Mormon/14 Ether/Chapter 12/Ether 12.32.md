[Ether 12:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.
