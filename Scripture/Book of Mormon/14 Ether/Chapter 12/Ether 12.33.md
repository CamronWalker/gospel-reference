[Ether 12:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men.
