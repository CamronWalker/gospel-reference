[Ether 12:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And now, I, Moroni, would speak somewhat concerning these things; I would show unto the world that faith is things which are hoped for and not seen; wherefore, dispute not because ye see not, for ye receive no witness until after the trial of your faith.
