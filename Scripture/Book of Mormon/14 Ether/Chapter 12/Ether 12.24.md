[Ether 12:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.
