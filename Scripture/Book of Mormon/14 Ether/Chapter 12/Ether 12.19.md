[Ether 12:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong, even before Christ came, who could not be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad.
