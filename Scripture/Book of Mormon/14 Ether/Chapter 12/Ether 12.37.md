[Ether 12:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.
