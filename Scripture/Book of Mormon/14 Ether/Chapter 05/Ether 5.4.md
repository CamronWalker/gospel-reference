[Ether 5:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/5?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the which shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear record--and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world at the last day.
