[Ether 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Therefore I do not write those things which transpired from the days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon the plates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get the full account.
