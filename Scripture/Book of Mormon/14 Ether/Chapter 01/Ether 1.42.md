[Ether 1:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And when thou hast done this thou shalt go at the head of them down into the valley which is northward. And there will I meet thee, and I will go before thee into a land which is choice above all the lands of the earth.
