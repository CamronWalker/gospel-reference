[Ether 1:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in his wrath that they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord the people were scattered.
