[Ether 1:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he did not confound the language of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not confounded.
