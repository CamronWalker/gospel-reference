[Ether 1:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) And there will I bless thee and thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy seed, and of the seed of thy brother, and they who shall go with thee, a great nation. And there shall be none greater than the nation which I will raise up unto me of thy seed, upon all the face of the earth. And thus I will do unto thee because this long time ye have cried unto me.
