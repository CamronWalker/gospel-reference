[Ether 8:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God of heaven, and also by the heavens, and also by the earth, and by their heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which Akish desired should lose his head; and whoso should divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same should lose his life.
