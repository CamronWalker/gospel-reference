[Ether 8:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that when they had slain the army of Jared they were about to slay him also; and he plead with them that they would not slay him, and he would give up the kingdom unto his father. And it came to pass that they did grant unto him his life.
