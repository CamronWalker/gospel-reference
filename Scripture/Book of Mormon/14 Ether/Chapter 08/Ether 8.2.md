[Ether 8:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in the land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter many people, because of his cunning words, until he had gained the half of the kingdom.
