[Ether 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it was the daughter of Jared who put it into his heart to search up these things of old; and Jared put it into the heart of Akish; wherefore, Akish administered it unto his kindred and friends, leading them away by fair promises to do whatsoever thing he desired.
