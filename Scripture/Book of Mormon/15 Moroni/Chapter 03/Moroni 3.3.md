[Moroni 3:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or, if he be a teacher) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach repentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.
