[Moroni 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And he called them by name, saying: Ye shall call on the Father in my name, in mighty prayer; and after ye have done this ye shall have power that to him upon whom ye shall lay your hands, ye shall give the Holy Ghost; and in my name shall ye give it, for thus do mine apostles.
