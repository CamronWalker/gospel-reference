[Moroni 8:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and partakers of salvation.
