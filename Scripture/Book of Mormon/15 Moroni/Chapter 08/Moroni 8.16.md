[Moroni 8:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not what man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.
