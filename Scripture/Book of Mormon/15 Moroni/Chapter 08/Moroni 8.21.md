[Moroni 8:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an endless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the judgment-seat of Christ.
