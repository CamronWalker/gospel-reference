[Moroni 8:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with them; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are denying the Holy Ghost.
