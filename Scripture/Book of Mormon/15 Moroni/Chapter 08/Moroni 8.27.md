[Moroni 8:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out soon against the Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except they should repent.
