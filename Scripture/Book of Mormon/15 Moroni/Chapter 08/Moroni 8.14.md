[Moroni 8:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.
