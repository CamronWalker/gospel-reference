[Moroni 8:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach--repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with their little children.
