[Moroni 8:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.
