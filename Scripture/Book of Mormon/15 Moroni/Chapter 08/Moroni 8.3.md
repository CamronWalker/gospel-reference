[Moroni 8:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite goodness and grace, will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to the end.
