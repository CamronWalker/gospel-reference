[Moroni 7:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will cleave unto every good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.
