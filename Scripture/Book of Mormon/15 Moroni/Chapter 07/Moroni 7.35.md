[Moroni 7:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with power and great glory at the last day, that they are true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?
