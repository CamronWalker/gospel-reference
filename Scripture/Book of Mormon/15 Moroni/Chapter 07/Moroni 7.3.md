[Moroni 7:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that are the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.
