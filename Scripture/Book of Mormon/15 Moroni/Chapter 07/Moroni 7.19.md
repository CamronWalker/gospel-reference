[Moroni 7:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.
