[Moroni 7:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?
