[Moroni 7:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted to speak unto you at this time.
