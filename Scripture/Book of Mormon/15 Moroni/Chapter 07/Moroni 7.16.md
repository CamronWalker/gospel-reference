[Moroni 7:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.
