[Moroni 7:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.
