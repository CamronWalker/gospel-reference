[Moroni 7:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.
