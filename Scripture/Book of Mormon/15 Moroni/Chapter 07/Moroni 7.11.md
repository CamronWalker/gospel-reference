[Moroni 7:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water; neither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore, a man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if he follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil.
