[Moroni 7:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.
