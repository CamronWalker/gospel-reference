[Moroni 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Wherefore, I write a few more things, contrary to that which I had supposed; for I had supposed not to have written any more; but I write a few more things, that perhaps they may be of worth unto my brethren, the Lamanites, in some future day, according to the will of the Lord.
