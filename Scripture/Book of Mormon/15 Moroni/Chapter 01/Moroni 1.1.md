[Moroni 1:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed not to have written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.
