[Moroni 9:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.
