[Moroni 9:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And now, my son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene. Behold, thou knowest the wickedness of this people; thou knowest that they are without principle, and past feeling; and their wickedness doth exceed that of the Lamanites.
