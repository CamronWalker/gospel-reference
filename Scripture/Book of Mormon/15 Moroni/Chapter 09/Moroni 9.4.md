[Moroni 9:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word of God with sharpness they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no sharpness they harden their hearts against it; wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased striving with them.
