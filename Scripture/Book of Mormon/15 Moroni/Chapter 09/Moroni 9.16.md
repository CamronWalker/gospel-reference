[Moroni 9:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And again, my son, there are many widows and their daughters who remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which the Lamanites did not carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has carried away, and left them to wander whithersoever they can for food; and many old women do faint by the way and die.
