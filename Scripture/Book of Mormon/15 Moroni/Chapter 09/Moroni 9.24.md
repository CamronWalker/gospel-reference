[Moroni 9:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our brethren have deserted over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also desert over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou art spared and I shall perish and not see thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon; for I have sacred records that I would deliver up unto thee.
