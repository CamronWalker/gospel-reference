[Moroni 9:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.
