[Moroni 9:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But behold, my son, I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved; and I pray unto God that he will spare thy life, to witness the return of his people unto him, or their utter destruction; for I know that they must perish except they repent and return unto him.
