[Moroni 9:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/9?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.
