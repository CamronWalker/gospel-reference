[Moroni 10:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And awake, and arise from the dust, O Jerusalem; yea, and put on thy beautiful garments, O daughter of Zion; and strengthen thy stakes and enlarge thy borders forever, that thou mayest no more be confounded, that the covenants of the Eternal Father which he hath made unto thee, O house of Israel, may be fulfilled.
