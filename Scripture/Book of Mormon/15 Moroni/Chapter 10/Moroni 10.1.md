[Moroni 10:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Now I, Moroni, write somewhat as seemeth me good; and I write unto my brethren, the Lamanites; and I would that they should know that more than four hundred and twenty years have passed away since the sign was given of the coming of Christ.
