[Moroni 10:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.
