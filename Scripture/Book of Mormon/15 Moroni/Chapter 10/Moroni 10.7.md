[Moroni 10:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.
