[Moroni 10:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And wo be unto the children of men if this be the case; for there shall be none that doeth good among you, no not one. For if there be one among you that doeth good, he shall work by the power and gifts of God.
