[Moroni 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And I would exhort you, my beloved brethren, that ye remember that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and that all these gifts of which I have spoken, which are spiritual, never will be done away, even as long as the world shall stand, only according to the unbelief of the children of men.
