[Moroni 10:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one speaking out of the dust?
