[Moroni 10:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.
