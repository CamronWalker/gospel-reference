[4 Nephi 1:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their fathers, even as it was in the beginning. And they were taught to hate the children of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to hate the children of Nephi from the beginning.
