[4 Nephi 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And they did not walk any more after the performances and ordinances of the law of Moses; but they did walk after the commandments which they had received from their Lord and their God, continuing in fasting and prayer, and in meeting together oft both to pray and to hear the word of the Lord.
