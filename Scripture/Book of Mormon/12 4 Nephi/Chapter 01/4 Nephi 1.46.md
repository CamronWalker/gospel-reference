[4 Nephi 1:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land; and there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in all manner of traffic.
