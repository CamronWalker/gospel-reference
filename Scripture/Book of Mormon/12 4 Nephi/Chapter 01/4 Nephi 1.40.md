[4 Nephi 1:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And it came to pass that two hundred and forty and four years had passed away, and thus were the affairs of the people. And the more wicked part of the people did wax strong, and became exceedingly more numerous than were the people of God.
