[3 Nephi 11:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words the whole multitude fell to the earth; for they remembered that it had been prophesied among them that Christ should show himself unto them after his ascension into heaven.
