[3 Nephi 11:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Arise and come forth unto me, that ye may thrust your hands into my side, and also that ye may feel the prints of the nails in my hands and in my feet, that ye may know that I am the God of Israel, and the God of the whole earth, and have been slain for the sins of the world.
