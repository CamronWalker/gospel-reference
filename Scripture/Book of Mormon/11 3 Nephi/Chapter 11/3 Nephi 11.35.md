[3 Nephi 11:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and I bear record of it from the Father; and whoso believeth in me believeth in the Father also; and unto him will the Father bear record of me, for he will visit him with fire and with the Holy Ghost.
