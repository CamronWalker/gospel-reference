[3 Nephi 11:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.
