[3 Nephi 11:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And whoso shall declare more or less than this, and establish it for my doctrine, the same cometh of evil, and is not built upon my rock; but he buildeth upon a sandy foundation, and the gates of hell stand open to receive such when the floods come and the winds beat upon them.
