[3 Nephi 11:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And again the Lord called others, and said unto them likewise; and he gave unto them power to baptize. And he said unto them: On this wise shall ye baptize; and there shall be no disputations among you.
