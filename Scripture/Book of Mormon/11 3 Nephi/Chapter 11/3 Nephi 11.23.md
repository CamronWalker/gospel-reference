[3 Nephi 11:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Verily I say unto you, that whoso repenteth of his sins through your words, and desireth to be baptized in my name, on this wise shall ye baptize them--Behold, ye shall go down and stand in the water, and in my name shall ye baptize them.
