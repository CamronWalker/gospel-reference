[3 Nephi 11:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And after this manner shall ye baptize in my name; for behold, verily I say unto you, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one; and I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one.
