[3 Nephi 11:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And behold, I am the light and the life of the world; and I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, and have glorified the Father in taking upon me the sins of the world, in the which I have suffered the will of the Father in all things from the beginning.
