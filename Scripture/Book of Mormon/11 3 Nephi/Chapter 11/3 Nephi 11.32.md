[3 Nephi 11:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And this is my doctrine, and it is the doctrine which the Father hath given unto me; and I bear record of the Father, and the Father beareth record of me, and the Holy Ghost beareth record of the Father and me; and I bear record that the Father commandeth all men, everywhere, to repent and believe in me.
