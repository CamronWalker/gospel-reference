[3 Nephi 11:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And according as I have commanded you thus shall ye baptize. And there shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.
