[3 Nephi 16:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) But if they will not turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, I will suffer them, yea, I will suffer my people, O house of Israel, that they shall go through among them, and shall tread them down, and they shall be as salt that hath lost its savor, which is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of my people, O house of Israel.
