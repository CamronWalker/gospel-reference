[3 Nephi 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But I have received a commandment of the Father that I shall go unto them, and that they shall hear my voice, and shall be numbered among my sheep, that there may be one fold and one shepherd; therefore I go to show myself unto them.
