[3 Nephi 22:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame; for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
