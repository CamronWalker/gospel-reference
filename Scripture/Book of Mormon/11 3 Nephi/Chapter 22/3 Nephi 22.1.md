[3 Nephi 22:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And then shall that which is written come to pass: Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child; for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith the Lord.
