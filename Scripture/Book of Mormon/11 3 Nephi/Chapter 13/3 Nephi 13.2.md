[3 Nephi 13:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Therefore, when ye shall do your alms do not sound a trumpet before you, as will hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.
