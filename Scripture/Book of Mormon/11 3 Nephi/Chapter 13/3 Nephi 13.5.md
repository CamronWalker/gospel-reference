[3 Nephi 13:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward.
