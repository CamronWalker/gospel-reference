[3 Nephi 13:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Verily, verily, I say that I would that ye should do alms unto the poor; but take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father who is in heaven.
