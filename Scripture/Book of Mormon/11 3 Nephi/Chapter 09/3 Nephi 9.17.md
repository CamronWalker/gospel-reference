[3 Nephi 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And as many as have received me, to them have I given to become the sons of God; and even so will I to as many as shall believe on my name, for behold, by me redemption cometh, and in me is the law of Moses fulfilled.
