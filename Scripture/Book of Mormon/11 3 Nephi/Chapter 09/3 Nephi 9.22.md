[3 Nephi 9:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Therefore, whoso repenteth and cometh unto me as a little child, him will I receive, for of such is the kingdom of God. Behold, for such I have laid down my life, and have taken it up again; therefore repent, and come unto me ye ends of the earth, and be saved.
