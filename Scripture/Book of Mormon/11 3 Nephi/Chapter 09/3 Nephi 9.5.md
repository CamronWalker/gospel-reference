[3 Nephi 9:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And behold, that great city Moronihah have I covered with earth, and the inhabitants thereof, to hide their iniquities and their abominations from before my face, that the blood of the prophets and the saints shall not come any more unto me against them.
