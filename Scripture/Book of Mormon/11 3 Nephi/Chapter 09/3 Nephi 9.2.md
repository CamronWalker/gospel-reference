[3 Nephi 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Wo, wo, wo unto this people; wo unto the inhabitants of the whole earth except they shall repent; for the devil laugheth, and his angels rejoice, because of the slain of the fair sons and daughters of my people; and it is because of their iniquity and abominations that they are fallen!
