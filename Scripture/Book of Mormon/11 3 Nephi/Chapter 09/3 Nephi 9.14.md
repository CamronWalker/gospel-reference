[3 Nephi 9:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Yea, verily I say unto you, if ye will come unto me ye shall have eternal life. Behold, mine arm of mercy is extended towards you, and whosoever will come, him will I receive; and blessed are those who come unto me.
