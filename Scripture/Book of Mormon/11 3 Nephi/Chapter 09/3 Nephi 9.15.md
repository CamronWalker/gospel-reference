[3 Nephi 9:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Behold, I am Jesus Christ the Son of God. I created the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are. I was with the Father from the beginning. I am in the Father, and the Father in me; and in me hath the Father glorified his name.
