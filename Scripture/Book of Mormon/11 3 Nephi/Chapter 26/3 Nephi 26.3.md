[3 Nephi 26:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And he did expound all things, even from the beginning until the time that he should come in his glory--yea, even all things which should come upon the face of the earth, even until the elements should melt with fervent heat, and the earth should be wrapt together as a scroll, and the heavens and the earth should pass away;
