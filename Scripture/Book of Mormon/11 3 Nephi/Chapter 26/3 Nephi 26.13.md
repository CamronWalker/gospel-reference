[3 Nephi 26:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Therefore, I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that he did show himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and give it unto them.
