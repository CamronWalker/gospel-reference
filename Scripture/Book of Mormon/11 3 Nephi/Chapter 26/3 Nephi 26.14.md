[3 Nephi 26:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the children of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did loose their tongues, and they did speak unto their fathers great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people; and he loosed their tongues that they could utter.
