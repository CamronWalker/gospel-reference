[3 Nephi 26:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) If they be good, to the resurrection of everlasting life; and if they be evil, to the resurrection of damnation; being on a parallel, the one on the one hand and the other on the other hand, according to the mercy, and the justice, and the holiness which is in Christ, who was before the world began.
