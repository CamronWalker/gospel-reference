[3 Nephi 26:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And these things have I written, which are a lesser part of the things which he taught the people; and I have written them to the intent that they may be brought again unto this people, from the Gentiles, according to the words which Jesus hath spoken.
