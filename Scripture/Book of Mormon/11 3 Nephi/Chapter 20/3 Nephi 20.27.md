[3 Nephi 20:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And after that ye were blessed then fulfilleth the Father the covenant which he made with Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed--unto the pouring out of the Holy Ghost through me upon the Gentiles, which blessing upon the Gentiles shall make them mighty above all, unto the scattering of my people, O house of Israel.
