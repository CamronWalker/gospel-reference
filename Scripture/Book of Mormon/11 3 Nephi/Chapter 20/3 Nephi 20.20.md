[3 Nephi 20:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that the sword of my justice shall hang over them at that day; and except they repent it shall fall upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon all the nations of the Gentiles.
