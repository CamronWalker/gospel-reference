[3 Nephi 20:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these things shall surely come, even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall this covenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled; and then shall Jerusalem be inhabited again with my people, and it shall be the land of their inheritance.
