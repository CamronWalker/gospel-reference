[3 Nephi 20:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he said unto them: He that eateth this bread eateth of my body to his soul; and he that drinketh of this wine drinketh of my blood to his soul; and his soul shall never hunger nor thirst, but shall be filled.
