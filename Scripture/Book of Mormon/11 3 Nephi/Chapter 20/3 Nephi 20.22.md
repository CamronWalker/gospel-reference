[3 Nephi 20:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem. And the powers of heaven shall be in the midst of this people; yea, even I will be in the midst of you.
