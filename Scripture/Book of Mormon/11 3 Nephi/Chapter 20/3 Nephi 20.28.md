[3 Nephi 20:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And they shall be a scourge unto the people of this land. Nevertheless, when they shall have received the fulness of my gospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me I will return their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the Father.
