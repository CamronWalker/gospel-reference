[3 Nephi 20:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever, saith the Father.
