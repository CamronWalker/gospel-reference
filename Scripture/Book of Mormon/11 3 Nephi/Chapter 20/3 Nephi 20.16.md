[3 Nephi 20:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Then shall ye, who are a remnant of the house of Jacob, go forth among them; and ye shall be in the midst of them who shall be many; and ye shall be among them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
