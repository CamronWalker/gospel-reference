[3 Nephi 20:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For I will make my people with whom the Father hath covenanted, yea, I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass. And thou shalt beat in pieces many people; and I will consecrate their gain unto the Lord, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth. And behold, I am he who doeth it.
