[3 Nephi 15:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And verily I say unto you, that ye are they of whom I said: Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
