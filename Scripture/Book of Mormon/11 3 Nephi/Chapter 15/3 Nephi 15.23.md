[3 Nephi 15:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And they understood me not that I said they shall hear my voice; and they understood me not that the Gentiles should not at any time hear my voice--that I should not manifest myself unto them save it were by the Holy Ghost.
