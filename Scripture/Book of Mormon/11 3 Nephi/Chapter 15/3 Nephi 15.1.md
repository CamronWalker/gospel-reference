[3 Nephi 15:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and said unto them: Behold, ye have heard the things which I taught before I ascended to my Father; therefore, whoso remembereth these sayings of mine and doeth them, him will I raise up at the last day.
