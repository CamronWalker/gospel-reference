[3 Nephi 15:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But, verily, I say unto you that the Father hath commanded me, and I tell it unto you, that ye were separated from among them because of their iniquity; therefore it is because of their iniquity that they know not of you.
