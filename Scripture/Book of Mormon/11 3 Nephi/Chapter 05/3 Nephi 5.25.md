[3 Nephi 5:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And as he hath covenanted with all the house of Jacob, even so shall the covenant wherewith he hath covenanted with the house of Jacob be fulfilled in his own due time, unto the restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant that he hath covenanted with them.
