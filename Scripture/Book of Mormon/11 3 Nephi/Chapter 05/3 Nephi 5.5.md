[3 Nephi 5:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But as many as there were who did not enter into a covenant, and who did still continue to have those secret murders in their hearts, yea, as many as were found breathing out threatenings against their brethren were condemned and punished according to the law.
