[3 Nephi 5:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God; and then shall they be gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own lands, from whence they have been dispersed; yea, as the Lord liveth so shall it be. Amen.
