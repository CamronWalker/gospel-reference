[3 Nephi 27:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And it came to pass that when Jesus had ended these sayings he said unto his disciples: Enter ye in at the strait gate; for strait is the gate, and narrow is the way that leads to life, and few there be that find it; but wide is the gate, and broad the way which leads to death, and many there be that travel therein, until the night cometh, wherein no man can work.
