[3 Nephi 27:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And how be it my church save it be called in my name? For if a church be called in Moses' name then it be Moses' church; or if it be called in the name of a man then it be the church of a man; but if it be called in my name then it is my church, if it so be that they are built upon my gospel.
