[3 Nephi 27:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And now, behold, my joy is great, even unto fulness, because of you, and also this generation; yea, and even the Father rejoiceth, and also all the holy angels, because of you and this generation; for none of them are lost.
