[3 Nephi 27:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.
