[3 Nephi 27:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And know ye that ye shall be judges of this people, according to the judgment which I shall give unto you, which shall be just. Therefore, what manner of men ought ye to be? Verily I say unto you, even as I am.
