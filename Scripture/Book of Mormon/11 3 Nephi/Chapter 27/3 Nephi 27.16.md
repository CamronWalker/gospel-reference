[3 Nephi 27:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And it shall come to pass, that whoso repenteth and is baptized in my name shall be filled; and if he endureth to the end, behold, him will I hold guiltless before my Father at that day when I shall stand to judge the world.
