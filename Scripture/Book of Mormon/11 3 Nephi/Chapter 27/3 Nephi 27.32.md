[3 Nephi 27:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) But behold, it sorroweth me because of the fourth generation from this generation, for they are led away captive by him even as was the son of perdition; for they will sell me for silver and for gold, and for that which moth doth corrupt and which thieves can break through and steal. And in that day will I visit them, even in turning their works upon their own heads.
