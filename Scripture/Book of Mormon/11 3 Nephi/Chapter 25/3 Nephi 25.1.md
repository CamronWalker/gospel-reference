[3 Nephi 25:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
