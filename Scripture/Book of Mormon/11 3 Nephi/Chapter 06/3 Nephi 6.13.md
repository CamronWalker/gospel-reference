[3 Nephi 6:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Some were lifted up in pride, and others were exceedingly humble; some did return railing for railing, while others would receive railing and persecution and all manner of afflictions, and would not turn and revile again, but were humble and penitent before God.
