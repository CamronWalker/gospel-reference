[3 Nephi 6:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And there began to be men inspired from heaven and sent forth, standing among the people in all the land, preaching and testifying boldly of the sins and iniquities of the people, and testifying unto them concerning the redemption which the Lord would make for his people, or in other words, the resurrection of Christ; and they did testify boldly of his death and sufferings.
