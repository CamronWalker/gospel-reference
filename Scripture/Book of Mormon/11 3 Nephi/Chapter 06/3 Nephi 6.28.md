[3 Nephi 6:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.
