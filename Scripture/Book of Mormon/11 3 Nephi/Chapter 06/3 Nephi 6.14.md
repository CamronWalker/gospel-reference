[3 Nephi 6:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And thus there became a great inequality in all the land, insomuch that the church began to be broken up; yea, insomuch that in the thirtieth year the church was broken up in all the land save it were among a few of the Lamanites who were converted unto the true faith; and they would not depart from it, for they were firm, and steadfast, and immovable, willing with all diligence to keep the commandments of the Lord.
