[3 Nephi 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.
