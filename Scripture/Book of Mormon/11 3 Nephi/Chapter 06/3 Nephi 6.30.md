[3 Nephi 6:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And they did set at defiance the law and the rights of their country; and they did covenant one with another to destroy the governor, and to establish a king over the land, that the land should no more be at liberty but should be subject unto kings.
