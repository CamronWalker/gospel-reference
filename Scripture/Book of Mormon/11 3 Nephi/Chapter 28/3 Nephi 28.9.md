[3 Nephi 28:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And again, ye shall not have pain while ye shall dwell in the flesh, neither sorrow save it be for the sins of the world; and all this will I do because of the thing which ye have desired of me, for ye have desired that ye might bring the souls of men unto me, while the world shall stand.
