[3 Nephi 28:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And wo be unto him that will not hearken unto the words of Jesus, and also to them whom he hath chosen and sent among them; for whoso receiveth not the words of Jesus and the words of those whom he hath sent receiveth not him; and therefore he will not receive them at the last day;
