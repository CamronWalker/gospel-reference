[3 Nephi 28:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And they were cast down into the earth; but they did smite the earth with the word of God, insomuch that by his power they were delivered out of the depths of the earth; and therefore they could not dig pits sufficient to hold them.
