[3 Nephi 28:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Therefore, more blessed are ye, for ye shall never taste of death; but ye shall live to behold all the doings of the Father unto the children of men, even until all things shall be fulfilled according to the will of the Father, when I shall come in my glory with the powers of heaven.
