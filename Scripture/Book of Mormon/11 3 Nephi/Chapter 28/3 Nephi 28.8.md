[3 Nephi 28:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And ye shall never endure the pains of death; but when I shall come in my glory ye shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye from mortality to immortality; and then shall ye be blessed in the kingdom of my Father.
