[3 Nephi 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.
