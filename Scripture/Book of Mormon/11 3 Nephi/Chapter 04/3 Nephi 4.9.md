[3 Nephi 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.
