[3 Nephi 4:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And in the twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.
