[3 Nephi 4:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.
