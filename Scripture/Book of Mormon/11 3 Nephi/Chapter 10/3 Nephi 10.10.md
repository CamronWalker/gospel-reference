[3 Nephi 10:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And the earth did cleave together again, that it stood; and the mourning, and the weeping, and the wailing of the people who were spared alive did cease; and their mourning was turned into joy, and their lamentations into the praise and thanksgiving unto the Lord Jesus Christ, their Redeemer.
