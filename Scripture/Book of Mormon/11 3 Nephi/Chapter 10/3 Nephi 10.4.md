[3 Nephi 10:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) O ye people of these great cities which have fallen, who are descendants of Jacob, yea, who are of the house of Israel, how oft have I gathered you as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and have nourished you.
