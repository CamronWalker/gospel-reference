[3 Nephi 10:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And they were spared and were not sunk and buried up in the earth; and they were not drowned in the depths of the sea; and they were not burned by fire, neither were they fallen upon and crushed to death; and they were not carried away in the whirlwind; neither were they overpowered by the vapor of smoke and of darkness.
