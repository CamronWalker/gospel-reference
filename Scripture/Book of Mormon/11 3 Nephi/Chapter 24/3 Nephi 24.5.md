[3 Nephi 24:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/24?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger, and fear not me, saith the Lord of Hosts.
