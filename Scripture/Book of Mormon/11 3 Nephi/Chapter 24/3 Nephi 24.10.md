[3 Nephi 24:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/24?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in my house; and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
