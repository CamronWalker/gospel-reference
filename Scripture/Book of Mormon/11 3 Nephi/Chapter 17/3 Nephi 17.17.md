[3 Nephi 17:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And no tongue can speak, neither can there be written by any man, neither can the hearts of men conceive so great and marvelous things as we both saw and heard Jesus speak; and no one can conceive of the joy which filled our souls at the time we heard him pray for us unto the Father.
