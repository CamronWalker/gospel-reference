[3 Nephi 17:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus spoken, he cast his eyes round about again on the multitude, and beheld they were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.
