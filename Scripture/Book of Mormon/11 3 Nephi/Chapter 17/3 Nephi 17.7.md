[3 Nephi 17:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Have ye any that are sick among you? Bring them hither. Have ye any that are lame, or blind, or halt, or maimed, or leprous, or that are withered, or that are deaf, or that are afflicted in any manner? Bring them hither and I will heal them, for I have compassion upon you; my bowels are filled with mercy.
