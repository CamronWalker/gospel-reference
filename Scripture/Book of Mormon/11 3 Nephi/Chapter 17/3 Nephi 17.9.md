[3 Nephi 17:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And it came to pass that when he had thus spoken, all the multitude, with one accord, did go forth with their sick and their afflicted, and their lame, and with their blind, and with their dumb, and with all them that were afflicted in any manner; and he did heal them every one as they were brought forth unto him.
