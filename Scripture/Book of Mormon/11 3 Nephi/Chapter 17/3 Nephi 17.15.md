[3 Nephi 17:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And when he had said these words, he himself also knelt upon the earth; and behold he prayed unto the Father, and the things which he prayed cannot be written, and the multitude did bear record who heard him.
