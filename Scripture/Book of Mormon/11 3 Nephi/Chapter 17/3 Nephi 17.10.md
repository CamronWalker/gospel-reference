[3 Nephi 17:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And they did all, both they who had been healed and they who were whole, bow down at his feet, and did worship him; and as many as could come for the multitude did kiss his feet, insomuch that they did bathe his feet with their tears.
