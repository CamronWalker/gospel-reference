[3 Nephi 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us--not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.
