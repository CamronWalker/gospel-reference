[3 Nephi 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.
