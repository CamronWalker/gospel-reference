[3 Nephi 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.
