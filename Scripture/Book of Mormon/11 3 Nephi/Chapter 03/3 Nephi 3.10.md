[3 Nephi 3:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.
