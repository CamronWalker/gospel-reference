[3 Nephi 3:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.
