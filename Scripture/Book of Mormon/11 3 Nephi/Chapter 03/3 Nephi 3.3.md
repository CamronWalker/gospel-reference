[3 Nephi 3:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word--Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.
