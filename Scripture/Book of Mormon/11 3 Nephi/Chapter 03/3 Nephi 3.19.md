[3 Nephi 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.
