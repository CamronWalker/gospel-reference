[3 Nephi 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass that the thirty and first year did pass away, and there were but few who were converted unto the Lord; but as many as were converted did truly signify unto the people that they had been visited by the power and Spirit of God, which was in Jesus Christ, in whom they believed.
