[3 Nephi 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.
