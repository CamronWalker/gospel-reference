[3 Nephi 7:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the people were divided one against another; and they did separate one from another into tribes, every man according to his family and his kindred and friends; and thus they did destroy the government of the land.
