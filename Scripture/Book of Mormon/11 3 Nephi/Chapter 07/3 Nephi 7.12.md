[3 Nephi 7:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.
