[3 Nephi 7:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Now behold, I will show unto you that they did not establish a king over the land; but in this same year, yea, the thirtieth year, they did destroy upon the judgment-seat, yea, did murder the chief judge of the land.
