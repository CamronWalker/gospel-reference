[3 Nephi 7:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass that they were angry with him, even because he had greater power than they, for it were not possible that they could disbelieve his words, for so great was his faith on the Lord Jesus Christ that angels did minister unto him daily.
