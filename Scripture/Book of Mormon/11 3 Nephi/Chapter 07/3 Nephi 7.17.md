[3 Nephi 7:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.
