[3 Nephi 19:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Father, I thank thee that thou hast purified those whom I have chosen, because of their faith, and I pray for them, and also for them who shall believe on their words, that they may be purified in me, through faith on their words, even as they are purified in me.
