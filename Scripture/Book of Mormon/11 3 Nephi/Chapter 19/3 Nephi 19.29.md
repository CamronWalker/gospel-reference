[3 Nephi 19:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Father, I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me out of the world, because of their faith, that they may be purified in me, that I may be in them as thou, Father, art in me, that we may be one, that I may be glorified in them.
