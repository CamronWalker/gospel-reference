[3 Nephi 19:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Father, thou hast given them the Holy Ghost because they believe in me; and thou seest that they believe in me because thou hearest them, and they pray unto me; and they pray unto me because I am with them.
