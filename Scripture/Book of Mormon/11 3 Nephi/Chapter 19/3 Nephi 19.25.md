[3 Nephi 19:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that Jesus blessed them as they did pray unto him; and his countenance did smile upon them, and the light of his countenance did shine upon them, and behold they were as white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness, yea, even there could be nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof.
