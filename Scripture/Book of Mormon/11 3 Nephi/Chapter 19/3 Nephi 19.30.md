[3 Nephi 19:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And when Jesus had spoken these words he came again unto his disciples; and behold they did pray steadfastly, without ceasing, unto him; and he did smile upon them again; and behold they were white, even as Jesus.
