[3 Nephi 19:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of praying he came again to the disciples, and said unto them: So great faith have I never seen among all the Jews; wherefore I could not show unto them so great miracles, because of their unbelief.
