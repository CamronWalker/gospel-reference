[3 Nephi 19:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And behold, they were encircled about as if it were by fire; and it came down from heaven, and the multitude did witness it, and did bear record; and angels did come down out of heaven and did minister unto them.
