[3 Nephi 12:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And behold, I have given you the law and the commandments of my Father, that ye shall believe in me, and that ye shall repent of your sins, and come unto me with a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Behold, ye have the commandments before you, and the law is fulfilled.
