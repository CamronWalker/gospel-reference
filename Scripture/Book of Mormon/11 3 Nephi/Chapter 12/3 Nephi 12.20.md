[3 Nephi 12:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Therefore come unto me and be ye saved; for verily I say unto you, that except ye shall keep my commandments, which I have commanded you at this time, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
