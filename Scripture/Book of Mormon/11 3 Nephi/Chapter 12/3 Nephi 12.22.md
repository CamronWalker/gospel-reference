[3 Nephi 12:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother shall be in danger of his judgment. And whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council; and whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
