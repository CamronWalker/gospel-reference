[3 Nephi 12:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And again, more blessed are they who shall believe in your words because that ye shall testify that ye have seen me, and that ye know that I am. Yea, blessed are they who shall believe in your words, and come down into the depths of humility and be baptized, for they shall be visited with fire and with the Holy Ghost, and shall receive a remission of their sins.
