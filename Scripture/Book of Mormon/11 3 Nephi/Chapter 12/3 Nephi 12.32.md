[3 Nephi 12:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Verily, verily, I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery; and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery.
