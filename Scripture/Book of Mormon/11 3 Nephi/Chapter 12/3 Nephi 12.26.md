[3 Nephi 12:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Verily, verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost senine. And while ye are in prison can ye pay even one senine? Verily, verily, I say unto you, Nay.
