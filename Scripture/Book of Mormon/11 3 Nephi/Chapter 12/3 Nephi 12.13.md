[3 Nephi 12:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Verily, verily, I say unto you, I give unto you to be the salt of the earth; but if the salt shall lose its savor wherewith shall the earth be salted? The salt shall be thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.
