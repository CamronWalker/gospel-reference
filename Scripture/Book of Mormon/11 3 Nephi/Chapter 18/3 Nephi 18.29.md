[3 Nephi 18:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) For whoso eateth and drinketh my flesh and blood unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to his soul; therefore if ye know that a man is unworthy to eat and drink of my flesh and blood ye shall forbid him.
