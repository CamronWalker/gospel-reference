[3 Nephi 18:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out from among you, but ye shall minister unto him and shall pray for him unto the Father, in my name; and if it so be that he repenteth and is baptized in my name, then shall ye receive him, and shall minister unto him of my flesh and blood.
