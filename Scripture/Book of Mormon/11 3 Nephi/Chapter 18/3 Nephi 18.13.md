[3 Nephi 18:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But whoso among you shall do more or less than these are not built upon my rock, but are built upon a sandy foundation; and when the rain descends, and the floods come, and the winds blow, and beat upon them, they shall fall, and the gates of hell are ready open to receive them.
