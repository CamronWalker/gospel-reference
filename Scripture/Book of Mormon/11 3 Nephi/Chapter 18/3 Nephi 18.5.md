[3 Nephi 18:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And when the multitude had eaten and were filled, he said unto the disciples: Behold there shall one be ordained among you, and to him will I give power that he shall break bread and bless it and give it unto the people of my church, unto all those who shall believe and be baptized in my name.
