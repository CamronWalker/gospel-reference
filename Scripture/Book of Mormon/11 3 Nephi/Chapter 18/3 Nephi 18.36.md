[3 Nephi 18:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of these sayings, he touched with his hand the disciples whom he had chosen, one by one, even until he had touched them all, and spake unto them as he touched them.
