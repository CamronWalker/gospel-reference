[3 Nephi 18:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Nevertheless, ye shall not cast him out of your synagogues, or your places of worship, for unto such shall ye continue to minister; for ye know not but what they will return and repent, and come unto me with full purpose of heart, and I shall heal them; and ye shall be the means of bringing salvation unto them.
