[3 Nephi 18:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And the multitude heard not the words which he spake, therefore they did not bear record; but the disciples bare record that he gave them power to give the Holy Ghost. And I will show unto you hereafter that this record is true.
