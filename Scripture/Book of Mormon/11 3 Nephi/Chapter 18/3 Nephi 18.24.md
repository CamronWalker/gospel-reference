[3 Nephi 18:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up--that which ye have seen me do. Behold ye see that I have prayed unto the Father, and ye all have witnessed.
