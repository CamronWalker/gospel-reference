[3 Nephi 18:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And this shall ye do in remembrance of my body, which I have shown unto you. And it shall be a testimony unto the Father that ye do always remember me. And if ye do always remember me ye shall have my Spirit to be with you.
