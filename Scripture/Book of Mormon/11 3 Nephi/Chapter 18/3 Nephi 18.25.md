[3 Nephi 18:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And ye see that I have commanded that none of you should go away, but rather have commanded that ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.
