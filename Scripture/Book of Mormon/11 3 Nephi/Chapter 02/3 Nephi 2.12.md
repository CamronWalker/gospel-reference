[3 Nephi 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.
