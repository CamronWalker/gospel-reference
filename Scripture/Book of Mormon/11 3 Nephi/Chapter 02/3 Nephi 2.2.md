[3 Nephi 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.
