[3 Nephi 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.
