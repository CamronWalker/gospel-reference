[3 Nephi 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.
