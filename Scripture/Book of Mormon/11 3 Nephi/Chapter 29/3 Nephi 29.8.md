[3 Nephi 29:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/29?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Yea, and ye need not any longer hiss, nor spurn, nor make game of the Jews, nor any of the remnant of the house of Israel; for behold, the Lord remembereth his covenant unto them, and he will do unto them according to that which he hath sworn.
