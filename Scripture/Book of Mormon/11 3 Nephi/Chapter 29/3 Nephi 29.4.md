[3 Nephi 29:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/29?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And when ye shall see these sayings coming forth among you, then ye need not any longer spurn at the doings of the Lord, for the sword of his justice is in his right hand; and behold, at that day, if ye shall spurn at his doings he will cause that it shall soon overtake you.
