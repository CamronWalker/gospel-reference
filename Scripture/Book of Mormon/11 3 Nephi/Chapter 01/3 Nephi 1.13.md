[3 Nephi 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.
