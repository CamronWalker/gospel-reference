[3 Nephi 1:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins. And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.
