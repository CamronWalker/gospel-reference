[3 Nephi 1:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.
