[3 Nephi 1:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.
