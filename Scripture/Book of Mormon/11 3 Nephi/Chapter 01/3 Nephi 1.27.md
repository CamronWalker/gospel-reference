[3 Nephi 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.
