[3 Nephi 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold, I come unto my own, to fulfil all things which I have made known unto the children of men from the foundation of the world, and to do the will, both of the Father and of the Son--of the Father because of me, and of the Son because of my flesh. And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.
