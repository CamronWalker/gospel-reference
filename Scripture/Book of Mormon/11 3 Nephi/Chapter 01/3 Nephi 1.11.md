[3 Nephi 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.
