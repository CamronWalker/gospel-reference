[3 Nephi 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.
