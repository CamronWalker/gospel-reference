[3 Nephi 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.
