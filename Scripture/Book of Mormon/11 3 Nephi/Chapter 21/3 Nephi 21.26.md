[3 Nephi 21:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day, even when this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this people. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem.
