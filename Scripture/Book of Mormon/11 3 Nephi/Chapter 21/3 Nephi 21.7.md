[3 Nephi 21:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And when these things come to pass that thy seed shall begin to know these things--it shall be a sign unto them, that they may know that the work of the Father hath already commenced unto the fulfilling of the covenant which he hath made unto the people who are of the house of Israel.
