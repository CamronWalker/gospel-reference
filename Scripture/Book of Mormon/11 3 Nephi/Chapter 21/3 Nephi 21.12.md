[3 Nephi 21:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.
