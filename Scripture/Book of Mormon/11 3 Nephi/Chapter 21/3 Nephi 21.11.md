[3 Nephi 21:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause him to bring forth unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be cut off from among my people who are of the covenant.
