[3 Nephi 21:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But behold, the life of my servant shall be in my hand; therefore they shall not hurt him, although he shall be marred because of them. Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.
