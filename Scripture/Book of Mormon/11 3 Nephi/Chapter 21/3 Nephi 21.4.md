[3 Nephi 21:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For it is wisdom in the Father that they should be established in this land, and be set up as a free people by the power of the Father, that these things might come forth from them unto a remnant of your seed, that the covenant of the Father may be fulfilled which he hath covenanted with his people, O house of Israel;
