[3 Nephi 21:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For in that day, for my sake shall the Father work a work, which shall be a great and a marvelous work among them; and there shall be among them those who will not believe it, although a man shall declare it unto them.
