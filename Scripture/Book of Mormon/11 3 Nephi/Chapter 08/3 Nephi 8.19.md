[3 Nephi 8:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that when the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the storm, and the tempest, and the quakings of the earth did cease--for behold, they did last for about the space of three hours; and it was said by some that the time was greater; nevertheless, all these great and terrible things were done in about the space of three hours--and then behold, there was darkness upon the face of the land.
