[3 Nephi 8:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that it did last for the space of three days that there was no light seen; and there was great mourning and howling and weeping among all the people continually; yea, great were the groanings of the people, because of the darkness and the great destruction which had come upon them.
