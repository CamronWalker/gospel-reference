[3 Nephi 8:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And in one place they were heard to cry, saying: O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and then would our brethren have been spared, and they would not have been burned in that great city Zarahemla.
