[Helaman 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds.
