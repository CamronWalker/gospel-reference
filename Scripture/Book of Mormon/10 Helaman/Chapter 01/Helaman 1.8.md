[Helaman 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.
