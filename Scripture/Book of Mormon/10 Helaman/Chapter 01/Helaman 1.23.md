[Helaman 1:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/1?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land.
