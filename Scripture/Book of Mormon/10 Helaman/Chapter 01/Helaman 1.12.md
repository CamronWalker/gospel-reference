[Helaman 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto death.
