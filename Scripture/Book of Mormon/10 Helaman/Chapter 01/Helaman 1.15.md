[Helaman 1:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/1?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And they came down again that they might pitch battle against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.
