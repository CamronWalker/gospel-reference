[Helaman 1:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/1?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.
