[Helaman 3:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And they have been handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.
