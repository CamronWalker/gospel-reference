[Helaman 3:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass in the forty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the robber had established in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.
