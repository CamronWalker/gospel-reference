[Helaman 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings.
