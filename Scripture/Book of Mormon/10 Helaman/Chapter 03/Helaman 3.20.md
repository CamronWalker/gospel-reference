[Helaman 3:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.
