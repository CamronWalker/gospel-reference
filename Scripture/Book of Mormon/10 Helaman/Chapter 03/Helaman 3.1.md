[Helaman 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now it came to pass in the forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.
