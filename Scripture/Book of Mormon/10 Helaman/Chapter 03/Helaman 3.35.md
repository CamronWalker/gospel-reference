[Helaman 3:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.
