[Helaman 3:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east.
