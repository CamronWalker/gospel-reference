[Helaman 3:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And it came to pass in the fifty and third year of the reign of the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.
