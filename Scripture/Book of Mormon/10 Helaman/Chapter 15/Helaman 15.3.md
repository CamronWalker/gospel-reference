[Helaman 15:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Yea, wo unto this people who are called the people of Nephi except they shall repent, when they shall see all these signs and wonders which shall be showed unto them; for behold, they have been a chosen people of the Lord; yea, the people of Nephi hath he loved, and also hath he chastened them; yea, in the days of their iniquities hath he chastened them because he loveth them.
