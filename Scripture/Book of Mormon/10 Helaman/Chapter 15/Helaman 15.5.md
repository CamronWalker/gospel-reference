[Helaman 15:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And I would that ye should behold that the more part of them are in the path of their duty, and they do walk circumspectly before God, and they do observe to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments according to the law of Moses.
