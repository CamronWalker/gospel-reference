[Helaman 15:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And ye know also that they have buried their weapons of war, and they fear to take them up lest by any means they should sin; yea, ye can see that they fear to sin--for behold they will suffer themselves that they be trodden down and slain by their enemies, and will not lift their swords against them, and this because of their faith in Christ.
