[Helaman 15:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) But behold my brethren, the Lamanites hath he hated because their deeds have been evil continually, and this because of the iniquity of the tradition of their fathers. But behold, salvation hath come unto them through the preaching of the Nephites; and for this intent hath the Lord prolonged their days.
