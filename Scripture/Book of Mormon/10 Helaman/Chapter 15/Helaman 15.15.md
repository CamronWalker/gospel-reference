[Helaman 15:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/15?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For behold, had the mighty works been shown unto them which have been shown unto you, yea, unto them who have dwindled in unbelief because of the traditions of their fathers, ye can see of yourselves that they never would again have dwindled in unbelief.
