[Helaman 10:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And now, because thou hast done this with such unwearyingness, behold, I will bless thee forever; and I will make thee mighty in word and in deed, in faith and in works; yea, even that all things shall be done unto thee according to thy word, for thou shalt not ask that which is contrary to my will.
