[Helaman 10:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Behold, thou art Nephi, and I am God. Behold, I declare it unto thee in the presence of mine angels, that ye shall have power over this people, and shall smite the earth with famine, and with pestilence, and destruction, according to the wickedness of this people.
