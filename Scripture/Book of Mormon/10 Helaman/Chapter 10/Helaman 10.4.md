[Helaman 10:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/10?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Blessed art thou, Nephi, for those things which thou hast done; for I have beheld how thou hast with unwearyingness declared the word, which I have given unto thee, unto this people. And thou hast not feared them, and hast not sought thine own life, but hast sought my will, and to keep my commandments.
