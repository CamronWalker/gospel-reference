[Helaman 5:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And it came to pass that he turned him about, and behold, he saw through the cloud of darkness the faces of Nephi and Lehi; and behold, they did shine exceedingly, even as the faces of angels. And he beheld that they did lift their eyes to heaven; and they were in the attitude as if talking or lifting their voices to some being whom they beheld.
