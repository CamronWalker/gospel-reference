[Helaman 5:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And behold the voice came again, saying: Repent ye, repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand; and seek no more to destroy my servants. And it came to pass that the earth shook again, and the walls trembled.
