[Helaman 5:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did stand forth and began to speak unto them, saying: Fear not, for behold, it is God that has shown unto you this marvelous thing, in the which is shown unto you that ye cannot lay your hands on us to slay us.
