[Helaman 5:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.
