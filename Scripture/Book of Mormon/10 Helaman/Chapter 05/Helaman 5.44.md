[Helaman 5:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) And Nephi and Lehi were in the midst of them; yea, they were encircled about; yea, they were as if in the midst of a flaming fire, yet it did harm them not, neither did it take hold upon the walls of the prison; and they were filled with that joy which is unspeakable and full of glory.
