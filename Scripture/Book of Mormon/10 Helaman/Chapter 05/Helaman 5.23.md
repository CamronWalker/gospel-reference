[Helaman 5:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi were encircled about as if by fire, even insomuch that they durst not lay their hands upon them for fear lest they should be burned. Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.
