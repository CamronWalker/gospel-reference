[Helaman 5:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And Aminadab said unto them: You must repent, and cry unto the voice, even until ye shall have faith in Christ, who was taught unto you by Alma, and Amulek, and Zeezrom; and when ye shall do this, the cloud of darkness shall be removed from overshadowing you.
