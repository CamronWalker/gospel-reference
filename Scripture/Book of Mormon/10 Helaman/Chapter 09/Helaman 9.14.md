[Helaman 9:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/9?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.
