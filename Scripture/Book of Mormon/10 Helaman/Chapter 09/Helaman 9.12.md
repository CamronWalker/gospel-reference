[Helaman 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead? And they answered and said: Concerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.
