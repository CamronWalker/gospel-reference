[Helaman 9:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/9?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.
