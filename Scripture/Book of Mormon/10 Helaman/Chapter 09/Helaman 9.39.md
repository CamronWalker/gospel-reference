[Helaman 9:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/9?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And there were some of the Nephites who believed on the words of Nephi; and there were some also, who believed because of the testimony of the five, for they had been converted while they were in prison.
