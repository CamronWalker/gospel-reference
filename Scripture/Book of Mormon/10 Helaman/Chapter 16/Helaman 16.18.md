[Helaman 16:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/16?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) That it is not reasonable that such a being as a Christ shall come; if so, and he be the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, as it has been spoken, why will he not show himself unto us as well as unto them who shall be at Jerusalem?
