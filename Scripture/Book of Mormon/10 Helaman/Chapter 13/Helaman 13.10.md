[Helaman 13:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yea, I will visit them in my fierce anger, and there shall be those of the fourth generation who shall live, of your enemies, to behold your utter destruction; and this shall surely come except ye repent, saith the Lord; and those of the fourth generation shall visit your destruction.
