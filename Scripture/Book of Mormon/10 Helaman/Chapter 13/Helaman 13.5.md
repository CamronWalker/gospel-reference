[Helaman 13:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And he said unto them: Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people.
