[Helaman 13:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And behold, an angel of the Lord hath declared it unto me, and he did bring glad tidings to my soul. And behold, I was sent unto you to declare it unto you also, that ye might have glad tidings; but behold ye would not receive me.
