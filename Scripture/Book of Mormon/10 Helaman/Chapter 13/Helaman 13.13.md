[Helaman 13:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But blessed are they who will repent, for them will I spare. But behold, if it were not for the righteous who are in this great city, behold, I would cause that fire should come down out of heaven and destroy it.
