[Helaman 13:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And the day shall come that they shall hide up their treasures, because they have set their hearts upon riches; and because they have set their hearts upon their riches, and will hide up their treasures when they shall flee before their enemies; because they will not hide them up unto me, cursed be they and also their treasures; and in that day shall they be smitten, saith the Lord.
