[Helaman 13:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Behold, we are surrounded by demons, yea, we are encircled about by the angels of him who hath sought to destroy our souls. Behold, our iniquities are great. O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in those days.
