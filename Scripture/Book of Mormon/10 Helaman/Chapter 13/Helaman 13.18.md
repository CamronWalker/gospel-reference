[Helaman 13:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it shall come to pass, saith the Lord of Hosts, yea, our great and true God, that whoso shall hide up treasures in the earth shall find them again no more, because of the great curse of the land, save he be a righteous man and shall hide it up unto the Lord.
