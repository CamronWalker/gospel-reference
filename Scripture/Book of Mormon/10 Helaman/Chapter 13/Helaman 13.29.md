[Helaman 13:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) O ye wicked and ye perverse generation; ye hardened and ye stiffnecked people, how long will ye suppose that the Lord will suffer you? Yea, how long will ye suffer yourselves to be led by foolish and blind guides? Yea, how long will ye choose darkness rather than light?
