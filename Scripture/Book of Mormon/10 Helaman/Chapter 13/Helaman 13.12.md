[Helaman 13:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Yea, wo unto this great city of Zarahemla; for behold, it is because of those who are righteous that it is saved; yea, wo unto this great city, for I perceive, saith the Lord, that there are many, yea, even the more part of this great city, that will harden their hearts against me, saith the Lord.
