[Helaman 13:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Yea, wo unto this people, because of this time which has arrived, that ye do cast out the prophets, and do mock them, and cast stones at them, and do slay them, and do all manner of iniquity unto them, even as they did of old time.
