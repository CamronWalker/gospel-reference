[Helaman 13:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) O that I had repented, and had not killed the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out. Yea, in that day ye shall say: O that we had remembered the Lord our God in the day that he gave us our riches, and then they would not have become slippery that we should lose them; for behold, our riches are gone from us.
