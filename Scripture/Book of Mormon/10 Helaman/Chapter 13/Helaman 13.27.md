[Helaman 13:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But behold, if a man shall come among you and shall say: Do this, and there is no iniquity; do that and ye shall not suffer; yea, he will say: Walk after the pride of your own hearts; yea, walk after the pride of your eyes, and do whatsoever your heart desireth--and if a man shall come among you and say this, ye will receive him, and say that he is a prophet.
