[Helaman 13:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.
