[Helaman 13:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Therefore, thus saith the Lord: Because of the hardness of the hearts of the people of the Nephites, except they repent I will take away my word from them, and I will withdraw my Spirit from them, and I will suffer them no longer, and I will turn the hearts of their brethren against them.
