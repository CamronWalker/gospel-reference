[Helaman 13:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For I will, saith the Lord, that they shall hide up their treasures unto me; and cursed be they who hide not up their treasures unto me; for none hideth up their treasures unto me save it be the righteous; and he that hideth not up his treasures unto me, cursed is he, and also the treasure, and none shall redeem it because of the curse of the land.
