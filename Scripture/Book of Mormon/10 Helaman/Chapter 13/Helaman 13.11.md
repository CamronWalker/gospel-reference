[Helaman 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But if ye will repent and return unto the Lord your God I will turn away mine anger, saith the Lord; yea, thus saith the Lord, blessed are they who will repent and turn unto me, but wo unto him that repenteth not.
