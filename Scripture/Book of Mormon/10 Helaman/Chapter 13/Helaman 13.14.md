[Helaman 13:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/13?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But behold, it is for the righteous' sake that it is spared. But behold, the time cometh, saith the Lord, that when ye shall cast out the righteous from among you, then shall ye be ripe for destruction; yea, wo be unto this great city, because of the wickedness and abominations which are in her.
