[Helaman 14:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) He hath given unto you that ye might know good from evil, and he hath given unto you that ye might choose life or death; and ye can do good and be restored unto that which is good, or have that which is good restored unto you; or ye can do evil, and have that which is evil restored unto you.
