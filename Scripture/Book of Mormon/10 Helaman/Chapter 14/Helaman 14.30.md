[Helaman 14:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.
