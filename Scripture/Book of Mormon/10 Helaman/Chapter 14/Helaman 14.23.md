[Helaman 14:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And behold, there shall be great tempests, and there shall be many mountains laid low, like unto a valley, and there shall be many places which are now called valleys which shall become mountains, whose height is great.
