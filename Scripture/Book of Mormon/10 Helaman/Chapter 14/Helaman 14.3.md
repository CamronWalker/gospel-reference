[Helaman 14:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.
