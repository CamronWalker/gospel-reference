[Helaman 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.
