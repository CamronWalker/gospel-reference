[Helaman 14:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death--that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.
