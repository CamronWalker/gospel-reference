[Helaman 14:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And behold, thus hath the Lord commanded me, by his angel, that I should come and tell this thing unto you; yea, he hath commanded that I should prophesy these things unto you; yea, he hath said unto me: Cry unto this people, repent and prepare the way of the Lord.
