[Helaman 14:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And this to the intent that whosoever will believe might be saved, and that whosoever will not believe, a righteous judgment might come upon them; and also if they are condemned they bring upon themselves their own condemnation.
