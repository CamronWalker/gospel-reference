[Helaman 14:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For behold, he surely must die that salvation may come; yea, it behooveth him and becometh expedient that he dieth, to bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, that thereby men may be brought into the presence of the Lord.
