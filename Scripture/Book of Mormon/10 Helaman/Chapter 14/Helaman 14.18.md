[Helaman 14:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Yea, and it bringeth to pass the condition of repentance, that whosoever repenteth the same is not hewn down and cast into the fire; but whosoever repenteth not is hewn down and cast into the fire; and there cometh upon them again a spiritual death, yea, a second death, for they are cut off again as to things pertaining to righteousness.
