[Helaman 7:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.
