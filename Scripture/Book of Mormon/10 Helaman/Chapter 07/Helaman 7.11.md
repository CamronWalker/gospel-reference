[Helaman 7:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.
