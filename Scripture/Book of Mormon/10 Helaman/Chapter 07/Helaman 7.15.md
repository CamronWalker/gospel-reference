[Helaman 7:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.
