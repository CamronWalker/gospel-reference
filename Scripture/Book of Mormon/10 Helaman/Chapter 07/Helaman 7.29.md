[Helaman 7:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall be.
