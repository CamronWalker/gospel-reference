[Helaman 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.
