[Helaman 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.
