[Helaman 7:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.
