[Helaman 7:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/7?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.
