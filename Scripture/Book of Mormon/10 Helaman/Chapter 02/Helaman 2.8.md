[Helaman 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.
