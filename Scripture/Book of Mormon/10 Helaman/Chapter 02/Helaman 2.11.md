[Helaman 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.
