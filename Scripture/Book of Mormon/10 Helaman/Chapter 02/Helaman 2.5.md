[Helaman 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.
