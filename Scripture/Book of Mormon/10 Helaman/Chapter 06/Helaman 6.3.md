[Helaman 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Nevertheless, the people of the church did have great joy because of the conversion of the Lamanites, yea, because of the church of God, which had been established among them. And they did fellowship one with another, and did rejoice one with another, and did have great joy.
