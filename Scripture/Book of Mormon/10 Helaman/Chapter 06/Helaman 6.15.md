[Helaman 6:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that in the sixty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, behold, Cezoram was murdered by an unknown hand as he sat upon the judgment-seat. And it came to pass that in the same year, that his son, who had been appointed by the people in his stead, was also murdered. And thus ended the sixty and sixth year.
