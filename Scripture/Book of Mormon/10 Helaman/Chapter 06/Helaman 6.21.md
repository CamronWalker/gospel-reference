[Helaman 6:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) But behold, Satan did stir up the hearts of the more part of the Nephites, insomuch that they did unite with those bands of robbers, and did enter into their covenants and their oaths, that they would protect and preserve one another in whatsoever difficult circumstances they should be placed, that they should not suffer for their murders, and their plunderings, and their stealings.
