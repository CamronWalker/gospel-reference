[Helaman 6:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And now behold, he had got great hold upon the hearts of the Nephites; yea, insomuch that they had become exceedingly wicked; yea, the more part of them had turned out of the way of righteousness, and did trample under their feet the commandments of God, and did turn unto their own ways, and did build up unto themselves idols of their gold and their silver.
