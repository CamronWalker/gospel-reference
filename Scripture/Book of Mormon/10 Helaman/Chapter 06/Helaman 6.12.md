[Helaman 6:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) They did raise grain in abundance, both in the north and in the south; and they did flourish exceedingly, both in the north and in the south. And they did multiply and wax exceedingly strong in the land. And they did raise many flocks and herds, yea, many fatlings.
