[Helaman 6:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And behold, it is he who is the author of all sin. And behold, he doth carry on his works of darkness and secret murder, and doth hand down their plots, and their oaths, and their covenants, and their plans of awful wickedness, from generation to generation according as he can get hold upon the hearts of the children of men.
