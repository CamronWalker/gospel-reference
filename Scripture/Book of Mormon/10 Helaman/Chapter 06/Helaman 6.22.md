[Helaman 6:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that they did have their signs, yea, their secret signs, and their secret words; and this that they might distinguish a brother who had entered into the covenant, that whatsoever wickedness his brother should do he should not be injured by his brother, nor by those who did belong to his band, who had taken this covenant.
