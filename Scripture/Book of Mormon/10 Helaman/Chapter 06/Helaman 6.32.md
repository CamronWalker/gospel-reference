[Helaman 6:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/6?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And it came to pass that all these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years, insomuch that a more part of it had come unto them in the sixty and seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.
