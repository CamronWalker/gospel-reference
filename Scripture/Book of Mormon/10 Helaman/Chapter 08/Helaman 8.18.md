[Helaman 8:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.
