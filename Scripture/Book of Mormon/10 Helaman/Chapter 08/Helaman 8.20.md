[Helaman 8:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?
