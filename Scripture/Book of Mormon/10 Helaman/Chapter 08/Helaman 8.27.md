[Helaman 8:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the judgment-seat, and search; and behold, your judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.
