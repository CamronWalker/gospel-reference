[Helaman 8:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment.
