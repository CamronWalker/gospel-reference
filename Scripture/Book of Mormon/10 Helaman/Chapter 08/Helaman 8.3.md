[Helaman 8:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.
