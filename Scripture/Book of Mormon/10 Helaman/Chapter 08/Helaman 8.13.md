[Helaman 8:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.
