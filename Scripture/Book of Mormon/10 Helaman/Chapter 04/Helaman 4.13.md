[Helaman 4:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.
