[Helaman 4:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.
