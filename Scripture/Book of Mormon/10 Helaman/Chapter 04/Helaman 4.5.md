[Helaman 4:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And in the fifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.
