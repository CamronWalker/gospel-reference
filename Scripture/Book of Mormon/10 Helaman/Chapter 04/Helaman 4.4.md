[Helaman 4:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.
