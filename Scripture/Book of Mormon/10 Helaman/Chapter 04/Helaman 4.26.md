[Helaman 4:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years.
