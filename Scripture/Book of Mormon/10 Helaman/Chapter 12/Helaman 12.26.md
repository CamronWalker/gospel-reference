[Helaman 12:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Yea, who shall be consigned to a state of endless misery, fulfilling the words which say: They that have done good shall have everlasting life; and they that have done evil shall have everlasting damnation. And thus it is. Amen.
