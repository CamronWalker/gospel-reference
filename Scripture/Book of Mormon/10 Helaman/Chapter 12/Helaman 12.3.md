[Helaman 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And thus we see that except the Lord doth chasten his people with many afflictions, yea, except he doth visit them with death and with terror, and with famine and with all manner of pestilence, they will not remember him.
