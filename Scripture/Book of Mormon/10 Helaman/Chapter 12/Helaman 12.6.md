[Helaman 12:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Behold, they do not desire that the Lord their God, who hath created them, should rule and reign over them; notwithstanding his great goodness and his mercy towards them, they do set at naught his counsels, and they will not that he should be their guide.
