[Helaman 12:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Yea, how quick to be lifted up in pride; yea, how quick to boast, and do all manner of that which is iniquity; and how slow are they to remember the Lord their God, and to give ear unto his counsels, yea, how slow to walk in wisdom's paths!
