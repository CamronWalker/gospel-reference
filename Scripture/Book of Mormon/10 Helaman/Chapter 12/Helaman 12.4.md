[Helaman 12:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) O how foolish, and how vain, and how evil, and devilish, and how quick to do iniquity, and how slow to do good, are the children of men; yea, how quick to hearken unto the words of the evil one, and to set their hearts upon the vain things of the world!
