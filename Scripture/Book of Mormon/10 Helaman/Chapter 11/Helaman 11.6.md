[Helaman 11:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/11?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And this work of destruction did also continue in the seventy and fifth year. For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.
