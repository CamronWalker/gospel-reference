[Helaman 11:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) O Lord, wilt thou hearken unto me, and cause that it may be done according to my words, and send forth rain upon the face of the earth, that she may bring forth her fruit, and her grain in the season of grain.
