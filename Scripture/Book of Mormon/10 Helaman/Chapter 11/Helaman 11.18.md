[Helaman 11:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/11?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.
