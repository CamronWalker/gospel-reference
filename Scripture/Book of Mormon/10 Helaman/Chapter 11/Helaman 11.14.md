[Helaman 11:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/11?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) O Lord, thou didst hearken unto my words when I said, Let there be a famine, that the pestilence of the sword might cease; and I know that thou wilt, even at this time, hearken unto my words, for thou saidst that: If this people repent I will spare them.
