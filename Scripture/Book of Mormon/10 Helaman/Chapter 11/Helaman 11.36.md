[Helaman 11:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/11?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And in the eighty and second year they began again to forget the Lord their God. And in the eighty and third year they began to wax strong in iniquity. And in the eighty and fourth year they did not mend their ways.
