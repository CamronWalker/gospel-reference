[Helaman 11:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/11?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.
