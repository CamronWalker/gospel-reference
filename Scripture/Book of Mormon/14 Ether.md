[Ether 1:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of those ancient inhabitants who were destroyed by the hand of the Lord upon the face of this north country. ^c1v1

[Ether 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And I take mine account from the twenty and four plates which were found by the people of Limhi, which is called the Book of Ether. ^c1v2

[Ether 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And as I suppose that the first part of this record, which speaks concerning the creation of the world, and also of Adam, and an account from that time even to the great tower, and whatsoever things transpired among the children of men until that time, is had among the Jews-- ^c1v3

[Ether 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Therefore I do not write those things which transpired from the days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon the plates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get the full account. ^c1v4

[Ether 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But behold, I give not the full account, but a part of the account I give, from the tower down until they were destroyed. ^c1v5

[Ether 1:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Which Jared came forth with his brother and their families, with some others and their families, from the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, and swore in his wrath that they should be scattered upon all the face of the earth; and according to the word of the Lord the people were scattered. ^c1v33

[Ether 1:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and a man highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our words. ^c1v34

[Ether 1:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Then Jared said unto his brother: Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends, that he confound not their language. ^c1v36

[Ether 1:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And it came to pass that the Lord did hear the brother of Jared, and had compassion upon him, and said unto him: ^c1v40

[Ether 1:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) Go to and gather together thy flocks, both male and female, of every kind; and also of the seed of the earth of every kind; and thy families; and also Jared thy brother and his family; and also thy friends and their families, and the friends of Jared and their families. ^c1v41

[Ether 1:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And when thou hast done this thou shalt go at the head of them down into the valley which is northward. And there will I meet thee, and I will go before thee into a land which is choice above all the lands of the earth. ^c1v42

[Ether 1:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/1?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) And there will I bless thee and thy seed, and raise up unto me of thy seed, and of the seed of thy brother, and they who shall go with thee, a great nation. And there shall be none greater than the nation which I will raise up unto me of thy seed, upon all the face of the earth. And thus I will do unto thee because this long time ye have cried unto me. ^c1v43

[Ether 2:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and also the friends of Jared and his brother and their families, went down into the valley which was northward, (and the name of the valley was Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter) with their flocks which they had gathered together, male and female, of every kind. ^c2v1

[Ether 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of the air; and they did also prepare a vessel, in which they did carry with them the fish of the waters. ^c2v2

[Ether 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And they did also carry with them deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did carry with them swarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon the face of the land, seeds of every kind. ^c2v3

[Ether 2:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And it came to pass that when they had come down into the valley of Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared saw him not. ^c2v4

[Ether 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel. ^c2v5

[Ether 2:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord. ^c2v6

[Ether 2:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people. ^c2v7

[Ether 2:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them. ^c2v8

[Ether 2:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity. ^c2v9

[Ether 2:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off. ^c2v10

[Ether 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God--that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done. ^c2v11

[Ether 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written. ^c2v12

[Ether 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years. ^c2v13

[Ether 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord. ^c2v14

[Ether 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who were with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember that my Spirit will not always strive with man; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And these are my thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands. ^c2v15

[Ether 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were small, and they were light upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water. ^c2v16

[Ether 2:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly tight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof were tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was tight like unto a dish. ^c2v17

[Ether 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast directed me. ^c2v18

[Ether 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall we steer? And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall perish. ^c2v19

[Ether 2:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air. And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood. ^c2v20

[Ether 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the Lord had commanded. ^c2v21

[Ether 2:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness? ^c2v22

[Ether 2:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire. ^c2v23

[Ether 2:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth. ^c2v24

[Ether 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea? ^c2v25

[Ether 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying: ^c3v1

[Ether 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires. ^c3v2

[Ether 3:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have molten out of the rock. ^c3v3

[Ether 3:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea. ^c3v4

[Ether 3:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men. ^c3v5

[Ether 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear. ^c3v6

[Ether 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen? ^c3v7

[Ether 3:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood. ^c3v8

[Ether 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this? ^c3v9

[Ether 3:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me. ^c3v10

[Ether 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I shall speak? ^c3v11

[Ether 3:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie. ^c3v12

[Ether 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed himself unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence; therefore I show myself unto you. ^c3v13

[Ether 3:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters. ^c3v14

[Ether 3:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image. ^c3v15

[Ether 3:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh. ^c3v16

[Ether 3:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And now, as I, Moroni, said I could not make a full account of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he showed himself unto the Nephites. ^c3v17

[Ether 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God, because of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto him. ^c3v18

[Ether 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting. ^c3v19

[Ether 3:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him. ^c3v20

[Ether 4:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for good cometh of none save it be of me.

For behold, I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world. ^c4v12

[Ether 6:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/6?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And accordingly the people were gathered together.

[Ether 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his desires. ^c7v22

[Ether 7:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the people, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon the land, and they should be destroyed if they did not repent. ^c7v23

[Ether 7:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it came to pass that the people did revile against the prophets, and did mock them.

[Ether 7:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave power unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they would; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance. ^c7v25

[Ether 7:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/7?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land.

[Ether 8:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And now Jared became exceedingly sorrowful because of the loss of the kingdom, for he had set his heart upon the kingdom and upon the glory of the world. ^c8v7

[Ether 8:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the record which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory? ^c8v9

[Ether 8:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king. ^c8v10

[Ether 8:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it came to pass that they all sware unto him, by the God of heaven, and also by the heavens, and also by the earth, and by their heads, that whoso should vary from the assistance which Akish desired should lose his head; and whoso should divulge whatsoever thing Akish made known unto them, the same should lose his life. ^c8v14

[Ether 8:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that thus they did agree with Akish. And Akish did administer unto them the oaths which were given by them of old who also sought power, which had been handed down even from Cain, who was a murderer from the beginning. ^c8v15

[Ether 8:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And they were kept up by the power of the devil to administer these oaths unto the people, to keep them in darkness, to help such as sought power to gain power, and to murder, and to plunder, and to lie, and to commit all manner of wickedness and whoredoms. ^c8v16

[Ether 8:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass that they formed a secret combination, even as they of old; which combination is most abominable and wicked above all, in the sight of God; ^c8v18

[Ether 8:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For the Lord worketh not in secret combinations, neither doth he will that man should shed blood, but in all things hath forbidden it, from the beginning of man. ^c8v19

[Ether 8:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And now I, Moroni, do not write the manner of their oaths and combinations, for it hath been made known unto me that they are had among all people, and they are had among the Lamanites. ^c8v20

[Ether 8:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And whatsoever nation shall uphold such secret combinations, to get power and gain, until they shall spread over the nation, behold, they shall be destroyed; for the Lord will not suffer that the blood of his saints, which shall be shed by them, shall always cry unto him from the ground for vengeance upon them and yet he avenge them not. ^c8v22

[Ether 8:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Wherefore, O ye Gentiles, it is wisdom in God that these things should be shown unto you, that thereby ye may repent of your sins, and suffer not that these murderous combinations shall get above you, which are built up to get power and gain--and the work, yea, even the work of destruction come upon you, yea, even the sword of the justice of the Eternal God shall fall upon you, to your overthrow and destruction if ye shall suffer these things to be. ^c8v23

[Ether 8:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Wherefore, the Lord commandeth you, when ye shall see these things come among you that ye shall awake to a sense of your awful situation, because of this secret combination which shall be among you; or wo be unto it, because of the blood of them who have been slain; for they cry from the dust for vengeance upon it, and also upon those who built it up. ^c8v24

[Ether 8:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) For it cometh to pass that whoso buildeth it up seeketh to overthrow the freedom of all lands, nations, and countries; and it bringeth to pass the destruction of all people, for it is built up by the devil, who is the father of all lies; even that same liar who beguiled our first parents, yea, even that same liar who hath caused man to commit murder from the beginning; who hath hardened the hearts of men that they have murdered the prophets, and stoned them, and cast them out from the beginning. ^c8v25

[Ether 8:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/8?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Wherefore, I, Moroni, am commanded to write these things that evil may be done away, and that the time may come that Satan may have no power upon the hearts of the children of men, but that they may be persuaded to do good continually, that they may come unto the fountain of all righteousness and be saved. ^c8v26

[Ether 9:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now I, Moroni, proceed with my record. Therefore, behold, it came to pass that because of the secret combinations of Akish and his friends, behold, they did overthrow the kingdom of Omer. ^c9v1

[Ether 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Nevertheless, the Lord was merciful unto Omer, and also to his sons and to his daughters who did not seek his destruction. ^c9v2

[Ether 9:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And the Lord warned Omer in a dream that he should depart out of the land; wherefore Omer departed out of the land with his family, and traveled many days, and came over and passed by the hill of Shim, and came over by the place where the Nephites were destroyed, and from thence eastward, and came to a place which was called Ablom, by the seashore, and there he pitched his tent, and also his sons and his daughters, and all his household, save it were Jared and his family. ^c9v3

[Ether 9:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that Akish sought the life of his father-in-law; and he applied unto those whom he had sworn by the oath of the ancients, and they obtained the head of his father-in-law, as he sat upon his throne, giving audience to his people. ^c9v5

[Ether 9:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For so great had been the spreading of this wicked and secret society that it had corrupted the hearts of all the people; therefore Jared was murdered upon his throne, and Akish reigned in his stead. ^c9v6

[Ether 9:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that Akish began to be jealous of his son, therefore he shut him up in prison, and kept him upon little or no food until he had suffered death. ^c9v7

[Ether 9:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now the brother of him that suffered death, (and his name was Nimrah) was angry with his father because of that which his father had done unto his brother. ^c9v8

[Ether 9:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And it came to pass that Nimrah gathered together a small number of men, and fled out of the land, and came over and dwelt with Omer. ^c9v9

[Ether 9:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Now the people of Akish were desirous for gain, even as Akish was desirous for power; wherefore, the sons of Akish did offer them money, by which means they drew away the more part of the people after them. ^c9v11

[Ether 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And there began to be a war between the sons of Akish and Akish, which lasted for the space of many years, yea, unto the destruction of nearly all the people of the kingdom, yea, even all, save it were thirty souls, and they who fled with the house of Omer. ^c9v12

And it came to pass that Emer did reign in his stead, and did fill the steps of his father. ^c9v15

[Ether 9:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And the Lord began again to take the curse from off the land, and the house of Emer did prosper exceedingly under the reign of Emer; and in the space of sixty and two years they had become exceedingly strong, insomuch that they became exceedingly rich-- ^c9v16

[Ether 9:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Having all manner of fruit, and of grain, and of silks, and of fine linen, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things; ^c9v17

[Ether 9:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And also all manner of cattle, of oxen, and cows, and of sheep, and of swine, and of goats, and also many other kinds of animals which were useful for the food of man. ^c9v18

[Ether 9:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And they also had horses, and asses, and there were elephants and cureloms and cumoms; all of which were useful unto man, and more especially the elephants and cureloms and cumoms. ^c9v19

[Ether 9:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/9?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And thus the Lord did pour out his blessings upon this land, which was choice above all other lands; and he commanded that whoso should possess the land should possess it unto the Lord, or they should be destroyed when they were ripened in iniquity; for upon such, saith the Lord: I will pour out the fulness of my wrath. ^c9v20

[Ether 12:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands.

[Ether 12:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for after they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power. ^c12v31

[Ether 12:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared. ^c12v32

[Ether 12:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men. ^c12v33

[Ether 12:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; wherefore, except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father. ^c12v34

[Ether 12:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever.

[Ether 13:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the destruction of the people of whom I have been writing. ^c13v1

[Ether 13:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the face thereof; ^c13v2

[Ether 13:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And that a New Jerusalem should be built up upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of Joseph, for which things there has been a type. ^c13v6

[Ether 13:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should perish not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should perish not. ^c13v7

[Ether 13:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the end come when the earth shall pass away. ^c13v8

[Ether 13:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they shall be like unto the old save the old have passed away, and all things have become new. ^c13v9

[Ether 13:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose garments are white through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of Israel. ^c13v10

[Ether 13:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made with their father, Abraham. ^c13v11

[Ether 13:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And when these things come, bringeth to pass the scripture which saith, there are they who were first, who shall be last; and there are they who were last, who shall be first. ^c13v12

[Ether 13:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people. ^c13v13

[Ether 13:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the remainder of this record, viewing the destructions which came upon the people, by night. ^c13v14

[Ether 13:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that in that same year in which he was cast out from among the people there began to be a great war among the people, for there were many who rose up, who were mighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret plans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken. ^c13v15

[Ether 13:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts of war and all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle unto them who sought to destroy him. ^c13v16

[Ether 13:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of the fair sons and daughters upon the face of the whole earth who repented of their sins. ^c13v17

[Ether 13:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether, that he should go and prophesy unto Coriantumr that, if he would repent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his kingdom and spare the people-- ^c13v20

[Ether 13:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household save it were himself. And he should only live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning another people receiving the land for their inheritance; and Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should be destroyed save it were Coriantumr. ^c13v21

[Ether 13:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his household, neither the people; and the wars ceased not; and they sought to kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again in the cavity of the rock. ^c13v22

[Ether 13:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that there arose up Shared, and he also gave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that in the third year he did bring him into captivity. ^c13v23

[Ether 13:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh, that he did not go to battle again for the space of two years, in which time all the people upon the face of the land were shedding blood, and there was none to restrain them. ^c13v31

[Ether 14:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now there began to be a great curse upon all the land because of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land. ^c14v1

[Ether 14:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own, with his hands, and would not borrow neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his own life and of his wives and children. ^c14v2

[Ether 14:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And now, after the space of two years, and after the death of Shared, behold, there arose the brother of Shared and he gave battle unto Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr did beat him and did pursue him to the wilderness of Akish. ^c14v3

[Ether 14:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz.

[Ether 14:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had been the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered with the bodies of the dead. ^c14v21

[Ether 14:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left to bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of blood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the worms of the flesh. ^c14v22

[Ether 14:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all the face of the land; wherefore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof. ^c14v23

[Ether 14:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr; for he had sworn to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, who had been slain, and the word of the Lord which came to Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword. ^c14v24

[Ether 14:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and Coriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr.

[Ether 14:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven again; and they came the second time, and they were driven again the second time.

[Ether 14:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/14?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so great that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp. ^c14v31

[Ether 15:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass when Coriantumr had recovered of his wounds, he began to remember the words which Ether had spoken unto him. ^c15v1

[Ether 15:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly two millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children. ^c15v2

[Ether 15:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted. ^c15v3

[Ether 15:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him that he would spare the people, and he would give up the kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people. ^c15v4

[Ether 15:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle he wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself up, that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would spare the lives of the people. ^c15v5

[Ether 15:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr. ^c15v6

[Ether 15:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/15?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall he fled again before the people of Shiz. ^c15v7
