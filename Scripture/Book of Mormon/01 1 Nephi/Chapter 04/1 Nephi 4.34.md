[1 Nephi 4:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us.
