[1 Nephi 4:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury.
