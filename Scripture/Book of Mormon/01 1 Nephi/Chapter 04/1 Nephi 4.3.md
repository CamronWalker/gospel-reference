[1 Nephi 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.
