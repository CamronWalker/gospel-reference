[1 Nephi 4:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.
