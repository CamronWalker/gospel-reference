[1 Nephi 4:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.
