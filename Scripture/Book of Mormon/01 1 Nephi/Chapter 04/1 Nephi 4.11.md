[1 Nephi 4:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.
