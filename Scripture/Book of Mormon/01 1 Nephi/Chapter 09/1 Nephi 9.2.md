[1 Nephi 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And now, as I have spoken concerning these plates, behold they are not the plates upon which I make a full account of the history of my people; for the plates upon which I make a full account of my people I have given the name of Nephi; wherefore, they are called the plates of Nephi, after mine own name; and these plates also are called the plates of Nephi.
