[1 Nephi 8:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.
