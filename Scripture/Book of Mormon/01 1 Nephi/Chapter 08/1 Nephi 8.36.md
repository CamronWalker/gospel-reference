[1 Nephi 8:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And it came to pass after my father had spoken all the words of his dream or vision, which were many, he said unto us, because of these things which he saw in a vision, he exceedingly feared for Laman and Lemuel; yea, he feared lest they should be cast off from the presence of the Lord.
