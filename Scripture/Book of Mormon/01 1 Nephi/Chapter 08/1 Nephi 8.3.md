[1 Nephi 8:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam; for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved.
