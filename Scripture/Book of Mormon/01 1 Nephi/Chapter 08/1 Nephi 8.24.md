[1 Nephi 8:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it came to pass that I beheld others pressing forward, and they came forth and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree.
