[1 Nephi 8:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) But, to be short in writing, behold, he saw other multitudes pressing forward; and they came and caught hold of the end of the rod of iron; and they did press their way forward, continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.
