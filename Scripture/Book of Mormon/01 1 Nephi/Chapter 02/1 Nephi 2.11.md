[1 Nephi 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart.
