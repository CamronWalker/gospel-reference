[1 Nephi 2:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.
