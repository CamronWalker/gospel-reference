[1 Nephi 2:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) For behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.
