[1 Nephi 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.
