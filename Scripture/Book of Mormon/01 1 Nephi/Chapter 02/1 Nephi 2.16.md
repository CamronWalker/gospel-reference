[1 Nephi 2:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.
