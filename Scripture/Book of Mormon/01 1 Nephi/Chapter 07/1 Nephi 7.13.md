[1 Nephi 7:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.
