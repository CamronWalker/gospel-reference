[1 Nephi 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my father, insomuch that they have driven him out of the land.
