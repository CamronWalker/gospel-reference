[1 Nephi 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.
