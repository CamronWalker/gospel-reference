[1 Nephi 7:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness, behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and the two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us; yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters.
