[1 Nephi 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our father. And after I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him.
