[1 Nephi 7:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman and unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto you, yea, and set an example for you?
