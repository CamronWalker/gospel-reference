[1 Nephi 7:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound.
