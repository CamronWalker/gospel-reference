[1 Nephi 7:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.
