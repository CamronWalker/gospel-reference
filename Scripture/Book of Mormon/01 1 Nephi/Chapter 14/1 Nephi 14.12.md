[1 Nephi 14:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw.
