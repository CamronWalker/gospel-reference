[1 Nephi 14:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, Nephi, saying: Thou hast beheld that if the Gentiles repent it shall be well with them; and thou also knowest concerning the covenants of the Lord unto the house of Israel; and thou also hast heard that whoso repenteth not must perish.
