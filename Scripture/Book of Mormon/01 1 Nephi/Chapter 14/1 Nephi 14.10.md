[1 Nephi 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And he said unto me: Behold there are save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth.
