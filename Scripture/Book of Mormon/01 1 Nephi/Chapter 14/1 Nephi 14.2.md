[1 Nephi 14:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And harden not their hearts against the Lamb of God, they shall be numbered among the seed of thy father; yea, they shall be numbered among the house of Israel; and they shall be a blessed people upon the promised land forever; they shall be no more brought down into captivity; and the house of Israel shall no more be confounded.
