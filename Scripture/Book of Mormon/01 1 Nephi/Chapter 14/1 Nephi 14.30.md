[1 Nephi 14:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And now I make an end of speaking concerning the things which I saw while I was carried away in the spirit; and if all the things which I saw are not written, the things which I have written are true. And thus it is. Amen.
