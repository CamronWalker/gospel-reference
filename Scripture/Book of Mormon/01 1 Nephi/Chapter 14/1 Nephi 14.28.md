[1 Nephi 14:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And behold, I, Nephi, am forbidden that I should write the remainder of the things which I saw and heard; wherefore the things which I have written sufficeth me; and I have written but a small part of the things which I saw.
