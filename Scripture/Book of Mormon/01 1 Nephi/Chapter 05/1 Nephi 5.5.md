[1 Nephi 5:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.
