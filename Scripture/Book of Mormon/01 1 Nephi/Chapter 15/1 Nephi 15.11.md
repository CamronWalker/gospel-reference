[1 Nephi 15:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Do ye not remember the things which the Lord hath said?--If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you.
