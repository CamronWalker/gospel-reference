[1 Nephi 15:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.
