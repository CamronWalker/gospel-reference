[1 Nephi 15:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Behold, I say unto you, that the house of Israel was compared unto an olive-tree, by the Spirit of the Lord which was in our father; and behold are we not broken off from the house of Israel, and are we not a branch of the house of Israel?
