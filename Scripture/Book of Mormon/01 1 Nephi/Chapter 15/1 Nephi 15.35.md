[1 Nephi 15:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And there is a place prepared, yea, even that awful hell of which I have spoken, and the devil is the preparator of it; wherefore the final state of the souls of men is to dwell in the kingdom of God, or to be cast out because of that justice of which I have spoken.
