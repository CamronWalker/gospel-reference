[1 Nephi 15:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And I did rehearse unto them the words of Isaiah, who spake concerning the restoration of the Jews, or of the house of Israel; and after they were restored they should no more be confounded, neither should they be scattered again. And it came to pass that I did speak many words unto my brethren, that they were pacified and did humble themselves before the Lord.
