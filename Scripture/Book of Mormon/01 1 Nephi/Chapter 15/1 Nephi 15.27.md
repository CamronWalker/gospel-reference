[1 Nephi 15:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I said unto them that the water which my father saw was filthiness; and so much was his mind swallowed up in other things that he beheld not the filthiness of the water. [Nephi was shown the same things as his father, but they saw different things.]
