[1 Nephi 15:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Wherefore, the wicked are rejected from the righteous, and also from that tree of life, whose fruit is most precious and most desirable above all other fruits; yea, and it is the greatest of all the gifts of God. And thus I spake unto my brethren. Amen.
