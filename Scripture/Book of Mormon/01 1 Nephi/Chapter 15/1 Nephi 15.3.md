[1 Nephi 15:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For he truly spake many great things unto them, which were hard to be understood, save a man should inquire of the Lord; and they being hard in their hearts, therefore they did not look unto the Lord as they ought.
