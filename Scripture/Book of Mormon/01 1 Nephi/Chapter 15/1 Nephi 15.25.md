[1 Nephi 15:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.
