[1 Nephi 1:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account of mine own life.
