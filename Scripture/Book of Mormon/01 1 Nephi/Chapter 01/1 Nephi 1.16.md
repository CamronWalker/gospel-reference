[1 Nephi 1:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account.
