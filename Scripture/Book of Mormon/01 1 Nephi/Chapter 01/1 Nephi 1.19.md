[1 Nephi 1:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.
