[1 Nephi 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem--that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.
