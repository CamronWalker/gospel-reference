[1 Nephi 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly.
