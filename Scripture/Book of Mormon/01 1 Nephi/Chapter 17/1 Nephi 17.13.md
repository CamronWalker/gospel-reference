[1 Nephi 17:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And I will also be your light in the wilderness; and I will prepare the way before you, if it so be that ye shall keep my commandments; wherefore, inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall be led towards the promised land; and ye shall know that it is by me that ye are led.
