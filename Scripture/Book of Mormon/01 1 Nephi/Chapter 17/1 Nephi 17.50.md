[1 Nephi 17:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) And I said unto them: If God had commanded me to do all things I could do them. If he should command me that I should say unto this water, be thou earth, it should be earth; and if I should say it, it would be done.
