[1 Nephi 17:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And we did come to the land which we called Bountiful, because of its much fruit and also wild honey; and all these things were prepared of the Lord that we might not perish. And we beheld the sea, which we called Irreantum, which, being interpreted, is many waters.
