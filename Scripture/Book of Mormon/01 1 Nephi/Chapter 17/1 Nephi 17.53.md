[1 Nephi 17:53](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p53#p53) And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and this will I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God.
