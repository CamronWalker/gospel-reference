[1 Nephi 17:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) Wherefore, the Lord commanded my father that he should depart into the wilderness; and the Jews also sought to take away his life; yea, and ye also have sought to take away his life; wherefore, ye are murderers in your hearts and ye are like unto them.
