[1 Nephi 17:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that we did again take our journey in the wilderness; and we did travel nearly eastward from that time forth. And we did travel and wade through much affliction in the wilderness; and our women did bear children in the wilderness.
