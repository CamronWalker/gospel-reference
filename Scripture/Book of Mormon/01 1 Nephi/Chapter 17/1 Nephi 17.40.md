[1 Nephi 17:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And he loveth those who will have him to be their God. Behold, he loved our fathers, and he covenanted with them, yea, even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and he remembered the covenants which he had made; wherefore, he did bring them out of the land of Egypt.
