[1 Nephi 17:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And it came to pass that according to his word he did destroy them; and according to his word he did lead them; and according to his word he did do all things for them; and there was not any thing done save it were by his word.
