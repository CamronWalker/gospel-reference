[1 Nephi 17:49](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p49#p49) And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto them that they should murmur no more against their father; neither should they withhold their labor from me, for God had commanded me that I should build a ship.
