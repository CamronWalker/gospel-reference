[1 Nephi 17:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And notwithstanding they being led, the Lord their God, their Redeemer, going before them, leading them by day and giving light unto them by night, and doing all things for them which were expedient for man to receive, they hardened their hearts and blinded their minds, and reviled against Moses and against the true and living God.
