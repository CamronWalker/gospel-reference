[1 Nephi 17:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And when my brethren saw that I was about to build a ship, they began to murmur against me, saying: Our brother is a fool, for he thinketh that he can build a ship; yea, and he also thinketh that he can cross these great waters.
