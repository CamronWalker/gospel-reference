[1 Nephi 17:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that we did pitch our tents by the seashore; and notwithstanding we had suffered many afflictions and much difficulty, yea, even so much that we cannot write them all, we were exceedingly rejoiced when we came to the seashore; and we called the place Bountiful, because of its much fruit.
