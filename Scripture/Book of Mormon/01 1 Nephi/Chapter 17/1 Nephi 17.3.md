[1 Nephi 17:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And thus we see that the commandments of God must be fulfilled. And if it so be that the children of men keep the commandments of God he doth nourish them, and strengthen them, and provide means whereby they can accomplish the thing which he has commanded them; wherefore, he did provide means for us while we did sojourn in the wilderness.
