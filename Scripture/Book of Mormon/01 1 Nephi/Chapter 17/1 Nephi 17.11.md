[1 Nephi 17:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/17?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make a bellows wherewith to blow the fire, of the skins of beasts; and after I had made a bellows, that I might have wherewith to blow the fire, I did smite two stones together that I might make fire.
