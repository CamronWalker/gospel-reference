[1 Nephi 10:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Wherefore, if ye have sought to do wickedly in the days of your probation, then ye are found unclean before the judgment-seat of God; and no unclean thing can dwell with God; wherefore, ye must be cast off forever.
