[1 Nephi 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) For he that diligently seeketh shall find; and the mysteries of God shall be unfolded unto them, by the power of the Holy Ghost, as well in these times as in times of old, and as well in times of old as in times to come; wherefore, the course of the Lord is one eternal round.
