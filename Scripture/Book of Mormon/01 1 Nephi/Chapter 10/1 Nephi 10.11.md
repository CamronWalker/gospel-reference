[1 Nephi 10:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass after my father had spoken these words he spake unto my brethren concerning the gospel which should be preached among the Jews, and also concerning the dwindling of the Jews in unbelief. And after they had slain the Messiah, who should come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.
