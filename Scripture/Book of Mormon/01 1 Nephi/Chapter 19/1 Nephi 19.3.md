[1 Nephi 19:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And after I had made these plates by way of commandment, I, Nephi, received a commandment that the ministry and the prophecies, the more plain and precious parts of them, should be written upon these plates; and that the things which were written should be kept for the instruction of my people, who should possess the land, and also for other wise purposes, which purposes are known unto the Lord.
