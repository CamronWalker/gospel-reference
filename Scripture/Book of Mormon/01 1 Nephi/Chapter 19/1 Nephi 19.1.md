[1 Nephi 19:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that the Lord commanded me, wherefore I did make plates of ore that I might engraven upon them the record of my people. And upon the plates which I made I did engraven the record of my father, and also our journeyings in the wilderness, and the prophecies of my father; and also many of mine own prophecies have I engraven upon them.
