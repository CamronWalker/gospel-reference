[1 Nephi 19:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And I knew not at the time when I made them that I should be commanded of the Lord to make these plates; wherefore, the record of my father, and the genealogy of his fathers, and the more part of all our proceedings in the wilderness are engraven upon those first plates of which I have spoken; wherefore, the things which transpired before I made these plates are, of a truth, more particularly made mention upon the first plates.
