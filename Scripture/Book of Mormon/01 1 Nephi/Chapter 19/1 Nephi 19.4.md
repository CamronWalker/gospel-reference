[1 Nephi 19:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Wherefore, I, Nephi, did make a record upon the other plates, which gives an account, or which gives a greater account of the wars and contentions and destructions of my people. And this have I done, and commanded my people what they should do after I was gone; and that these plates should be handed down from one generation to another, or from one prophet to another, until further commandments of the Lord.
