[1 Nephi 19:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he surely did show unto the prophets of old all things concerning them; and also he did show unto many concerning us; wherefore, it must needs be that we know concerning them for they are written upon the plates of brass.
