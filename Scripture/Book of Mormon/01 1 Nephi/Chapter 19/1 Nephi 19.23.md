[1 Nephi 19:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And I did read many things unto them which were written in the books of Moses; but that I might more fully persuade them to believe in the Lord their Redeemer I did read unto them that which was written by the prophet Isaiah; for I did liken all scriptures unto us, that it might be for our profit and learning.
