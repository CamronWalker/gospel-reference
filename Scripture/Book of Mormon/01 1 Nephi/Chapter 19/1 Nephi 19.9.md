[1 Nephi 19:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the world, because of their iniquity, shall judge him to be a thing of naught; wherefore they scourge him, and he suffereth it; and they smite him, and he suffereth it. Yea, they spit upon him, and he suffereth it, because of his loving kindness and his long-suffering towards the children of men.
