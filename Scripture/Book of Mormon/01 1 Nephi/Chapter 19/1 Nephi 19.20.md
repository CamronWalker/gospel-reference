[1 Nephi 19:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) For behold, I have workings in the spirit, which doth weary me even that all my joints are weak, for those who are at Jerusalem; for had not the Lord been merciful, to show unto me concerning them, even as he had prophets of old, I should have perished also.
