[1 Nephi 19:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And because they turn their hearts aside, saith the prophet, and have despised the Holy One of Israel, they shall wander in the flesh, and perish, and become a hiss and a byword, and be hated among all nations.
