[1 Nephi 19:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For thus spake the prophet: The Lord God surely shall visit all the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up.
