[1 Nephi 6:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after upon these plates which I am writing; for it is given in the record which has been kept by my father; wherefore, I do not write it in this work.
