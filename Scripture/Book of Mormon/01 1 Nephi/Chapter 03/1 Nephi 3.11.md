[1 Nephi 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And we cast lots--who of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.
