[1 Nephi 3:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?
