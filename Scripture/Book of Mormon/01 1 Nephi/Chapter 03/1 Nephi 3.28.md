[1 Nephi 3:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.
