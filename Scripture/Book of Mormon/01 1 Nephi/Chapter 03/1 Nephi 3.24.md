[1 Nephi 3:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.
