[1 Nephi 11:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.
