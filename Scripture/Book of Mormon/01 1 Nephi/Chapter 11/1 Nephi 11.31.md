[1 Nephi 11:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
