[1 Nephi 11:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
