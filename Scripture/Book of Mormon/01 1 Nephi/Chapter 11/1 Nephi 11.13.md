[1 Nephi 11:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.
