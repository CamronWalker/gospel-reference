[1 Nephi 11:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another. [Lehi saw a vision, but Nephi gets the guided tour of it.]
