[1 Nephi 11:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
