[1 Nephi 11:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.
