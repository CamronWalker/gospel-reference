[1 Nephi 11:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
