[1 Nephi 22:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.
