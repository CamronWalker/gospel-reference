[1 Nephi 22:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel reigneth.
