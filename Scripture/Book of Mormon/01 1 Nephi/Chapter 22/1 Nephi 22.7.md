[1 Nephi 22:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered.
