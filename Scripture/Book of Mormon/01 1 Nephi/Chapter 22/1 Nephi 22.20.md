[1 Nephi 22:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people.
