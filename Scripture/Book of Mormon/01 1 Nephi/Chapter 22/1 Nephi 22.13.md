[1 Nephi 22:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood.
