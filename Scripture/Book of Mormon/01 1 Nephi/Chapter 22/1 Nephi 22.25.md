[1 Nephi 22:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.
