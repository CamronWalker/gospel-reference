[1 Nephi 22:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned.
