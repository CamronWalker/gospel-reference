[1 Nephi 22:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.
