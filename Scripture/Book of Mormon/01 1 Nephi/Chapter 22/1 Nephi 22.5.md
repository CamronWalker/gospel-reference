[1 Nephi 22:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And since they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel; for against him will they harden their hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations and shall be hated of all men.
