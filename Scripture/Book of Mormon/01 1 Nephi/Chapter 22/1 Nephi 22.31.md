[1 Nephi 22:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen.
