[1 Nephi 22:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/22?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear; for thus saith the prophet, they shall be saved, even if it so be as by fire.
