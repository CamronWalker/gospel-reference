[1 Nephi 21:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And now, saith the Lord--that formed me from the womb that I should be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him--though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and my God shall be my strength.
