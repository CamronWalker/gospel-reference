[1 Nephi 21:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I, the Lord, am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
