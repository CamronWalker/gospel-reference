[1 Nephi 21:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Lift up thine eyes round about and behold; all these gather themselves together, and they shall come to thee. And as I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on even as a bride.
