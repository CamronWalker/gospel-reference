[1 Nephi 21:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Thus saith the Lord, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One, to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nations abhorreth, to servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the Lord that is faithful.
