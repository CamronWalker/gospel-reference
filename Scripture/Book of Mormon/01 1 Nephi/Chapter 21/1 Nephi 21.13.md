[1 Nephi 21:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; for the feet of those who are in the east shall be established; and break forth into singing, O mountains; for they shall be smitten no more; for the Lord hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted.
