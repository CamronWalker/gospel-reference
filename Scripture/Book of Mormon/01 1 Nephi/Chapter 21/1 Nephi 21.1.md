[1 Nephi 21:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And again: Hearken, O ye house of Israel, all ye that are broken off and are driven out because of the wickedness of the pastors of my people; yea, all ye that are broken off, that are scattered abroad, who are of my people, O house of Israel. Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken ye people from far; the Lord hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name.
