[1 Nephi 21:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) But thus saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for I will contend with him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children.
