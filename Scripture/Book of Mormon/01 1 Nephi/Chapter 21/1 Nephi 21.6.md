[1 Nephi 21:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And he said: It is a light thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel. I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth.
