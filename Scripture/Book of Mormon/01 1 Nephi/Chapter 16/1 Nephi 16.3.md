[1 Nephi 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us.
