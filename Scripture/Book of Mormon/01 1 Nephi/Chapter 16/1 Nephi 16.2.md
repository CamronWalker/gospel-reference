[1 Nephi 16:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that I said unto them that I knew that I had spoken hard things against the wicked, according to the truth; and the righteous have I justified, and testified that they should be lifted up at the last day; wherefore, the guilty taketh the truth to be hard, for it cutteth them to the very center.
