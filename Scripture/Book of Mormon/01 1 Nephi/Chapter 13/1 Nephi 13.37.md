[1 Nephi 13:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) And blessed are they who shall seek to bring forth my Zion at that day, for they shall have the gift and the power of the Holy Ghost; and if they endure unto the end they shall be lifted up at the last day, and shall be saved in the everlasting kingdom of the Lamb; and whoso shall publish peace, yea, tidings of great joy, how beautiful upon the mountains shall they be.
