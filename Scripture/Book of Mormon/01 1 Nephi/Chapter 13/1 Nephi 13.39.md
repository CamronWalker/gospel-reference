[1 Nephi 13:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And after it had come forth unto them I beheld other books, which came forth by the power of the Lamb, from the Gentiles unto them, unto the convincing of the Gentiles and the remnant of the seed of my brethren, and also the Jews who were scattered upon all the face of the earth, that the records of the prophets and of the twelve apostles of the Lamb are true.
