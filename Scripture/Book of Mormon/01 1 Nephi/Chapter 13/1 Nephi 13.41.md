[1 Nephi 13:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) And they must come according to the words which shall be established by the mouth of the Lamb; and the words of the Lamb shall be made known in the records of thy seed, as well as in the records of the twelve apostles of the Lamb; wherefore they both shall be established in one; for there is one God and one Shepherd over all the earth.
