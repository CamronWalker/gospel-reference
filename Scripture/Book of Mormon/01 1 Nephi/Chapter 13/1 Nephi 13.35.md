[1 Nephi 13:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) For, behold, saith the Lamb: I will manifest myself unto thy seed, that they shall write many things which I shall minister unto them, which shall be plain and precious; and after thy seed shall be destroyed, and dwindle in unbelief, and also the seed of thy brethren, behold, these things shall be hid up, to come forth unto the Gentiles, by the gift and power of the Lamb.
