[1 Nephi 13:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it came to pass that I beheld many multitudes of the Gentiles upon the land of promise; and I beheld the wrath of God, that it was upon the seed of my brethren; and they were scattered before the Gentiles and were smitten.
