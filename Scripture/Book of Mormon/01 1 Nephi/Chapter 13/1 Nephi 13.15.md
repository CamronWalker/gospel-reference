[1 Nephi 13:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And I beheld the Spirit of the Lord, that it was upon the Gentiles, and they did prosper and obtain the land for their inheritance; and I beheld that they were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people before they were slain.
