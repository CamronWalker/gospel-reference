[1 Nephi 13:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And the time cometh that he shall manifest himself unto all nations, both unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles; and after he has manifested himself unto the Jews and also unto the Gentiles, then he shall manifest himself unto the Gentiles and also unto the Jews, and the last shall be first, and the first shall be last.
