[1 Nephi 18:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it came to pass that we did begin to till the earth, and we began to plant seeds; yea, we did put all our seeds into the earth, which we had brought from the land of Jerusalem. And it came to pass that they did grow exceedingly; wherefore, we were blessed in abundance.
