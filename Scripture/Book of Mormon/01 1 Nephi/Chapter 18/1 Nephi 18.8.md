[1 Nephi 18:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass after we had all gone down into the ship, and had taken with us our provisions and things which had been commanded us, we did put forth into the sea and were driven forth before the wind towards the promised land.
