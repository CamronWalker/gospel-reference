[1 Nephi 18:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that after we had sailed for the space of many days we did arrive at the promised land; and we went forth upon the land, and did pitch our tents; and we did call it the promised land.
