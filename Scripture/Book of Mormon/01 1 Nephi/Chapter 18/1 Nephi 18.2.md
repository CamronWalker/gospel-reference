[1 Nephi 18:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Now I, Nephi, did not work the timbers after the manner which was learned by men, neither did I build the ship after the manner of men; but I did build it after the manner which the Lord had shown unto me; wherefore, it was not after the manner of men.
