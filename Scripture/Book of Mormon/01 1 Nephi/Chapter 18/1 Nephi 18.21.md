[1 Nephi 18:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass after they had loosed me, behold, I took the compass, and it did work whither I desired it. And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord; and after I had prayed the winds did cease, and the storm did cease, and there was a great calm.
