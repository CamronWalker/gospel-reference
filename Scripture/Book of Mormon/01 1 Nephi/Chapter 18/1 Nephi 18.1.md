[1 Nephi 18:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that they did worship the Lord, and did go forth with me; and we did work timbers of curious workmanship. And the Lord did show me from time to time after what manner I should work the timbers of the ship.
