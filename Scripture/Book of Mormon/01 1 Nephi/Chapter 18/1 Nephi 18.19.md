[1 Nephi 18:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And Jacob and Joseph also, being young, having need of much nourishment, were grieved because of the afflictions of their mother; and also my wife with her tears and prayers, and also my children, did not soften the hearts of my brethren that they would loose me.
