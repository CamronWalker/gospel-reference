[1 Nephi 18:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/18?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that Laman and Lemuel did take me and bind me with cords, and they did treat me with much harshness; nevertheless, the Lord did suffer it that he might show forth his power, unto the fulfilling of his word which he had spoken concerning the wicked.
