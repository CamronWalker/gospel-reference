[1 Nephi 20:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And I have even from the beginning declared to thee; before it came to pass I showed them thee; and I showed them for fear lest thou shouldst say--Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image hath commanded them.
