[1 Nephi 12:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And the mists of darkness are the temptations of the devil, which blindeth the eyes, and hardeneth the hearts of the children of men, and leadeth them away into broad roads, [as opposed to the strait and narrow way] that they perish and are lost.
