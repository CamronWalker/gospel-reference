[1 Nephi 12:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And the large and spacious building, which thy father saw, is vain imaginations and the pride of the children of men. And a great and a terrible gulf divideth them; yea, even the word of the justice of the Eternal God, and the Messiah who is the Lamb of God, of whom the Holy Ghost beareth record, from the beginning of the world until this time, and from this time henceforth and forever.
