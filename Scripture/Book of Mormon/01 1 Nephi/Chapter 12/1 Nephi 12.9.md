[1 Nephi 12:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And he said unto me: Thou rememberest the twelve apostles of the Lamb? Behold they are they who shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, the twelve ministers of thy seed shall be judged of them; for ye are of the house of Israel.
