[1 Nephi 12:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass after I saw these things, I saw the vapor of darkness, that it passed from off the face of the earth; and behold, I saw multitudes who had not fallen because of the great and terrible judgments of the Lord.
