[2 Nephi 33:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But I, Nephi, have written what I have written, and I esteem it as of great worth, and especially unto my people. For I pray continually for them by day, and mine eyes water my pillow by night, because of them; and I cry unto my God in faith, and I know that he will hear my cry.
