[2 Nephi 33:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And now, my beloved brethren, all those who are of the house of Israel, and all ye ends of the earth, I speak unto you as the voice of one crying from the dust: Farewell until that great day shall come.
