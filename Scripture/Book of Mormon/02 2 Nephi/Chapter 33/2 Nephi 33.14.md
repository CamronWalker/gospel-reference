[2 Nephi 33:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And you that will not partake of the goodness of God, and respect the words of the Jews, and also my words, and the words which shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the Lamb of God, behold, I bid you an everlasting farewell, for these words shall condemn you at the last day.
