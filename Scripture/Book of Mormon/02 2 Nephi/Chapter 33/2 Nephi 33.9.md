[2 Nephi 33:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) I also have charity for the Gentiles. But behold, for none of these can I hope except they shall be reconciled unto Christ, and enter into the narrow gate, and walk in the strait path which leads to life, and continue in the path until the end of the day of probation.
