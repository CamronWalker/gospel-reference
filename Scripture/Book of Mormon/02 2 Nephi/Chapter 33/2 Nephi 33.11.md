[2 Nephi 33:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And if they are not the words of Christ, judge ye--for Christ will show unto you, with power and great glory, that they are his words, at the last day; and you and I shall stand face to face before his bar; and ye shall know that I have been commanded of him to write these things, notwithstanding my weakness.
