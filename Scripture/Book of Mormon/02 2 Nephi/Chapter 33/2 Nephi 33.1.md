[2 Nephi 33:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now I, Nephi, cannot write all the things which were taught among my people; neither am I mighty in writing, like unto speaking; for when a man speaketh by the power of the Holy Ghost the power of the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children of men.
