[2 Nephi 33:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And now, my beloved brethren, and also Jew, and all ye ends of the earth, hearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye will believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me; and they teach all men that they should do good.
