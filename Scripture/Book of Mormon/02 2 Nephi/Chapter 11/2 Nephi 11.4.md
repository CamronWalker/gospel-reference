[2 Nephi 11:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Behold, my soul delighteth in proving unto my people the truth of the coming of Christ; for, for this end hath the law of Moses been given; and all things which have been given of God from the beginning of the world, unto man, are the typifying of him.
