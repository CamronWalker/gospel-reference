[2 Nephi 11:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And my brother, Jacob, also has seen him as I have seen him; wherefore, I will send their words forth unto my children to prove unto them that my words are true. Wherefore, by the words of three, God hath said, I will establish my word. Nevertheless, God sendeth more witnesses, and he proveth all his words.
