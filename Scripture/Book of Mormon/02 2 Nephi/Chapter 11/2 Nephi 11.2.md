[2 Nephi 11:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/11?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And now I, Nephi, write more of the words of Isaiah, for my soul delighteth in his words. For I will liken his words unto my people, and I will send them forth unto all my children, for he verily saw my Redeemer, even as I have seen him.
