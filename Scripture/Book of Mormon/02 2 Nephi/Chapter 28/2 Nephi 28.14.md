[2 Nephi 28:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) They wear stiff necks and high heads; yea, and because of pride, and wickedness, and abominations, and whoredoms, they have all gone astray save it be a few, who are the humble followers of Christ; nevertheless, they are led, that in many instances they do err because they are taught by the precepts of men.
