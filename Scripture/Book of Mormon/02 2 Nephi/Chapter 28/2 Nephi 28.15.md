[2 Nephi 28:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) O the wise, and the learned, and the rich, that are puffed up in the pride of their hearts, and all those who preach false doctrines, and all those who commit whoredoms, and pervert the right way of the Lord, wo, wo, wo be unto them, saith the Lord God Almighty, for they shall be thrust down to hell!
