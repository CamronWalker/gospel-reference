[2 Nephi 28:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And in fine, wo unto all those who tremble, and are angry because of the truth of God! For behold, he that is built upon the rock receiveth it with gladness; and he that is built upon a sandy foundation trembleth lest he shall fall.
