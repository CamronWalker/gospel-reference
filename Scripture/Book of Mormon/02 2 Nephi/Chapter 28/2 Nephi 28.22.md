[2 Nephi 28:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And behold, others he flattereth away, and telleth them there is no hell; and he saith unto them: I am no devil, for there is none--and thus he whispereth in their ears, until he grasps them with his awful chains, from whence there is no deliverance.
