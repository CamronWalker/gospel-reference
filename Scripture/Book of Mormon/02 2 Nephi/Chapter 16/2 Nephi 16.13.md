[2 Nephi 16:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall return, and shall be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
