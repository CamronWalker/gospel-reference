[2 Nephi 16:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/16?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes--lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and be healed.
