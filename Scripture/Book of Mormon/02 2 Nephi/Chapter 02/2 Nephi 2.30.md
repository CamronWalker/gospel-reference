[2 Nephi 2:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.
