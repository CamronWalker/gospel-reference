[2 Nephi 2:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.
