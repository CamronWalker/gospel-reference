[2 Nephi 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.
