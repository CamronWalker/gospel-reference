[2 Nephi 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.
