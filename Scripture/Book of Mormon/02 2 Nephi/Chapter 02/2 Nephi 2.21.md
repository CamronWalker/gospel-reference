[2 Nephi 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.
