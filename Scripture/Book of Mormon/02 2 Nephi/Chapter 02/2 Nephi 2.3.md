[2 Nephi 2:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.
