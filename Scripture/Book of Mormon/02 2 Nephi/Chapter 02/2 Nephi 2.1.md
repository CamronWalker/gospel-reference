[2 Nephi 2:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my first-born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren.
