[2 Nephi 2:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.
