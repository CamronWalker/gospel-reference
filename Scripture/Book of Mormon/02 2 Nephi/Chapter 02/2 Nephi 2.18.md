[2 Nephi 2:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.
