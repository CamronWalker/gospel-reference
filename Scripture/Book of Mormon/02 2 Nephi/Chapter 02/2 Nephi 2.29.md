[2 Nephi 2:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.
