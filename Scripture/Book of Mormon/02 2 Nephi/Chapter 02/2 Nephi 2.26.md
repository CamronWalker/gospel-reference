[2 Nephi 2:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.
