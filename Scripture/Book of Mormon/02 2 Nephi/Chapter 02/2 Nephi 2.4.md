[2 Nephi 2:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free.
