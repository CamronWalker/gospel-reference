[2 Nephi 20:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Shall the ax boast itself against him that heweth therewith? Shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? As if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood!
