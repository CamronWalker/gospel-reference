[2 Nephi 30:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Wherefore, all things which have been revealed unto the children of men shall at that day be revealed; and Satan shall have power over the hearts of the children of men no more, for a long time. And now, my beloved brethren, I make an end of my sayings.
