[2 Nephi 30:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And now, I would prophesy somewhat more concerning the Jews and the Gentiles. For after the book of which I have spoken shall come forth, and be written unto the Gentiles, and sealed up again unto the Lord, there shall be many which shall believe the words which are written; and they shall carry them forth unto the remnant of our seed.
