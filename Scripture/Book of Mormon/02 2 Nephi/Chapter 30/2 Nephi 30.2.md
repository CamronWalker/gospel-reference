[2 Nephi 30:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For behold, I say unto you that as many of the Gentiles as will repent are the covenant people of the Lord; and as many of the Jews as will not repent shall be cast off; for the Lord covenanteth with none save it be with them that repent and believe in his Son, who is the Holy One of Israel.
