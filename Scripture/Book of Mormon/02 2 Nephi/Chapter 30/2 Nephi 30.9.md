[2 Nephi 30:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And with righteousness shall the Lord God judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth. And he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth; and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.
