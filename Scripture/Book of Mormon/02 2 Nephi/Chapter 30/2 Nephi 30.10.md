[2 Nephi 30:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For the time speedily cometh that the Lord God shall cause a great division among the people, and the wicked will he destroy; and he will spare his people, yea, even if it so be that he must destroy the wicked by fire.
