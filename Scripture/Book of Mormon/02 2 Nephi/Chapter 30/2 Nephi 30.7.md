[2 Nephi 30:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it shall come to pass that the Jews which are scattered also shall begin to believe in Christ; and they shall begin to gather in upon the face of the land; and as many as shall believe in Christ shall also become a delightsome people.
