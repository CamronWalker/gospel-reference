[2 Nephi 30:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/30?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) There is nothing which is secret save it shall be revealed; there is no work of darkness save it shall be made manifest in the light; and there is nothing which is sealed upon the earth save it shall be loosed.
