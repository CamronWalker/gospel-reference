[2 Nephi 5:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.
