[2 Nephi 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.
