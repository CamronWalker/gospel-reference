[2 Nephi 5:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people.
