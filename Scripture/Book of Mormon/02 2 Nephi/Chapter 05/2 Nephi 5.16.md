[2 Nephi 5:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.
