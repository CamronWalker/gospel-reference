[2 Nephi 5:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.
