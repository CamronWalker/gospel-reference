[2 Nephi 5:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were cut off from his presence.
