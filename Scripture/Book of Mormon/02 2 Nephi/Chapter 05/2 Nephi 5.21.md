[2 Nephi 5:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.
