[2 Nephi 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time they sought to take away my life.
