[2 Nephi 13:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it shall come to pass, instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle, a rent; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a stomacher, a girding of sackcloth; burning instead of beauty.
