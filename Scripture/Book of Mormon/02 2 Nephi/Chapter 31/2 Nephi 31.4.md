[2 Nephi 31:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.
