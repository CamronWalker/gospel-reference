[2 Nephi 31:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men. Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.
