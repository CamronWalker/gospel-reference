[2 Nephi 31:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things, which I know must surely come to pass; neither can I write but a few of the words of my brother Jacob.
