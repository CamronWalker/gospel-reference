[2 Nephi 31:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for ye have not come thus far save it were by the word of Christ with unshaken faith in him, relying wholly upon the merits of him who is mighty to save.
