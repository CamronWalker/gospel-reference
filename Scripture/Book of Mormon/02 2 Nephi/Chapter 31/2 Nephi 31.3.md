[2 Nephi 31:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For my soul delighteth in plainness; for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding; for he speaketh unto men according to their language, unto their understanding.
