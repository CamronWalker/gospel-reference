[2 Nephi 31:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.
