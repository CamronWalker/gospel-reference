[2 Nephi 31:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.
