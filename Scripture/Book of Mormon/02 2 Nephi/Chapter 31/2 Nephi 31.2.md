[2 Nephi 31:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/31?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Wherefore, the things which I have written sufficeth me, save it be a few words which I must speak concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying.
