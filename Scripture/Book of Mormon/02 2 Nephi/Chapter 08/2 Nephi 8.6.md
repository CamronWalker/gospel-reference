[2 Nephi 8:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment; and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner. But my salvation shall be forever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
