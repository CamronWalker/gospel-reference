[2 Nephi 8:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Thus saith thy Lord, the Lord and thy God pleadeth the cause of his people; behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again.
