[2 Nephi 8:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/8?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For the Lord shall comfort Zion, he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the Lord. Joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving and the voice of melody.
