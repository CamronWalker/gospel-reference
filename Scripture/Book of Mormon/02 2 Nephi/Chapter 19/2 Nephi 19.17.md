[2 Nephi 19:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows; for every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
