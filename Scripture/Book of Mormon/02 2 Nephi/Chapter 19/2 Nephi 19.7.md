[2 Nephi 19:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/19?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.
