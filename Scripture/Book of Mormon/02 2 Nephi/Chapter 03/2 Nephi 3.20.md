[2 Nephi 3:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto their brethren, even after many generations have gone by them. And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words.
