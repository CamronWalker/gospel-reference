[2 Nephi 3:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Because of their faith their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren who are the fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy fathers.
