[2 Nephi 3:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And the words which he shall write shall be the words which are expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the dust; for I know their faith.
