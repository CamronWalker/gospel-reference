[2 Nephi 3:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.
