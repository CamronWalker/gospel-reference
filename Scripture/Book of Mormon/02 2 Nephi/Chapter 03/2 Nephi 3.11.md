[2 Nephi 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins--and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.
