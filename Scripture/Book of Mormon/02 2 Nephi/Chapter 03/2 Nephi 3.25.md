[2 Nephi 3:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little; wherefore hearken unto the words of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall be done unto thee even according to the words which I have spoken. Remember the words of thy dying father. Amen.
