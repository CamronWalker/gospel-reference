[2 Nephi 3:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much, for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.
