[2 Nephi 3:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, which is a most precious land, for thine inheritance and the inheritance of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.
