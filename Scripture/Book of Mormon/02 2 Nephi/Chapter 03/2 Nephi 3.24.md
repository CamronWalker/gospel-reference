[2 Nephi 3:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/3?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And there shall rise up one mighty among them, who shall do much good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren.
