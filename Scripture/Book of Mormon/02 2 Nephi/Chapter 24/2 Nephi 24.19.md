[2 Nephi 24:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/24?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and the remnant of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.
