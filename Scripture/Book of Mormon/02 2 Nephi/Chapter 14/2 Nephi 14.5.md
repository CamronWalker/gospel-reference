[2 Nephi 14:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/14?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And the Lord will create upon every dwelling-place of mount Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for upon all the glory of Zion shall be a defence.
