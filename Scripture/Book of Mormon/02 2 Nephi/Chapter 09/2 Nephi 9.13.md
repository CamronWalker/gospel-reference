[2 Nephi 9:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.
