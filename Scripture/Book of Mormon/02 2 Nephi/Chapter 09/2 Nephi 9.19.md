[2 Nephi 9:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) O the greatness of the mercy of our God, the Holy One of Israel! For he delivereth his saints from that awful monster the devil, and death, and hell, and that lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment.
