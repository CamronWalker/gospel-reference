[2 Nephi 9:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God.
