[2 Nephi 9:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) But wo unto the rich, who are rich as to the things of the world. For because they are rich they despise the poor, and they persecute the meek, and their hearts are upon their treasures; wherefore, their treasure is their god. And behold, their treasure shall perish with them also.
