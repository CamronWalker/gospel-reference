[2 Nephi 9:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.
