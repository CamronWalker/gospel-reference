[2 Nephi 9:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) O the wisdom of God, his mercy and grace! For behold, if the flesh should rise no more our spirits must become subject to that angel who fell from before the presence of the Eternal God, and became the devil, to rise no more.
