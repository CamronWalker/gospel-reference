[2 Nephi 9:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) For the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given to them, that they are delivered from that awful monster, death and hell, and the devil, and the lake of fire and brimstone, which is endless torment; and they are restored to that God who gave them breath, which is the Holy One of Israel.
