[2 Nephi 9:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he cometh into the world that he may save all men if they will hearken unto his voice; for behold, he suffereth the pains of all men, yea, the pains of every living creature, both men, women, and children, who belong to the family of Adam.
