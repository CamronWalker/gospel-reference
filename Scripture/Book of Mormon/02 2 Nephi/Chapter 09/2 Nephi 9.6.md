[2 Nephi 9:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.
