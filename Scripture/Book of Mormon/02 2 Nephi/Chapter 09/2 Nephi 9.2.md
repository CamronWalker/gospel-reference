[2 Nephi 9:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.
