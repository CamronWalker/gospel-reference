[2 Nephi 9:51](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p51#p51) Wherefore, do not spend money for that which is of no worth, nor your labor for that which cannot satisfy. Hearken diligently unto me, and remember the words which I have spoken; and come unto the Holy One of Israel, and feast upon that which perisheth not, neither can be corrupted, and let your soul delight in fatness.
