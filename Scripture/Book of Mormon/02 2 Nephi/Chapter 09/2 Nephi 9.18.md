[2 Nephi 9:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But, behold, the righteous, the saints of the Holy One of Israel, they who have believed in the Holy One of Israel, they who have endured the crosses of the world, and despised the shame of it, they shall inherit the kingdom of God, which was prepared for them from the foundation of the world, and their joy shall be full forever.
