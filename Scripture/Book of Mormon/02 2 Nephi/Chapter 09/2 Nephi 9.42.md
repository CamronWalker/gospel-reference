[2 Nephi 9:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And whoso knocketh, to him will he open; and the wise, and the learned, and they that are rich, who are puffed up because of their learning, and their wisdom, and their riches--yea, they are they whom he despiseth; and save they shall cast these things away, and consider themselves fools before God, and come down in the depths of humility, he will not open unto them.
