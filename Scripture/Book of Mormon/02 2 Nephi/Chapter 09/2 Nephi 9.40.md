[2 Nephi 9:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) O, my beloved brethren, give ear to my words. Remember the greatness of the Holy One of Israel. Do not say that I have spoken hard things against you; for if ye do, ye will revile against the truth; for I have spoken the words of your Maker. I know that the words of truth are hard against all uncleanness; but the righteous fear them not, for they love the truth and are not shaken.
