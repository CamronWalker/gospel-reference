[2 Nephi 9:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.
