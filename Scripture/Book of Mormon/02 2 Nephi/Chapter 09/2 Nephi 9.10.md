[2 Nephi 9:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) O how great the goodness of our God, who prepareth a way for our escape from the grasp of this awful monster; yea, that monster, death and hell, which I call the death of the body, and also the death of the spirit.
