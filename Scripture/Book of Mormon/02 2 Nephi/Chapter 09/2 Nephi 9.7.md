[2 Nephi 9:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement--save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.
