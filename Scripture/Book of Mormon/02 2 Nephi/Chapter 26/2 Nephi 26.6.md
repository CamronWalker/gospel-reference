[2 Nephi 26:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And they shall be visited with thunderings, and lightnings, and earthquakes, and all manner of destructions, for the fire of the anger of the Lord shall be kindled against them, and they shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh shall consume them, saith the Lord of Hosts.
