[2 Nephi 26:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And after the Messiah shall come there shall be signs given unto my people of his birth, and also of his death and resurrection; and great and terrible shall that day be unto the wicked, for they shall perish; and they perish because they cast out the prophets, and the saints, and stone them, and slay them; wherefore the cry of the blood of the saints shall ascend up to God from the ground against them.
