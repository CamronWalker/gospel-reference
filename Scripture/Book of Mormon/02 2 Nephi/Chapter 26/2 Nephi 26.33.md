[2 Nephi 26:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and Gentile.
