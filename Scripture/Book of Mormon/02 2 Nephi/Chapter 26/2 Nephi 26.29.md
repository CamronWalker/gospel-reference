[2 Nephi 26:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) He commandeth that there shall be no priestcrafts; for, behold, priestcrafts are that men preach and set themselves up for a light unto the world, that they may get gain and praise of the world; but they seek not the welfare of Zion.
