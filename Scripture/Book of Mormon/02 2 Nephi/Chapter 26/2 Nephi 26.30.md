[2 Nephi 26:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Behold, the Lord hath forbidden this thing; wherefore, the Lord God hath given a commandment that all men should have charity, which charity is love. And except they should have charity they were nothing. Wherefore, if they should have charity they would not suffer the laborer in Zion to perish.
