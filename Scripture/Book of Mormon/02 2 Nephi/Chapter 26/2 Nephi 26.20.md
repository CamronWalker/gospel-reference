[2 Nephi 26:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And the Gentiles are lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and have stumbled, because of the greatness of their stumbling block, that they have built up many churches; nevertheless, they put down the power and miracles of God, and preach up unto themselves their own wisdom and their own learning, that they may get gain and grind upon the face of the poor.
