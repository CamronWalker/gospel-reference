[2 Nephi 26:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For those who shall be destroyed shall speak unto them out of the ground, and their speech shall be low out of the dust, and their voice shall be as one that hath a familiar spirit; for the Lord God will give unto him power, that he may whisper concerning them, even as it were out of the ground; and their speech shall whisper out of the dust.
