[2 Nephi 26:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And they that kill the prophets, and the saints, the depths of the earth shall swallow them up, saith the Lord of Hosts; and mountains shall cover them, and whirlwinds shall carry them away, and buildings shall fall upon them and crush them to pieces and grind them to powder.
