[2 Nephi 26:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) O the pain, and the anguish of my soul for the loss of the slain of my people! For I, Nephi, have seen it, and it well nigh consumeth me before the presence of the Lord; but I must cry unto my God: Thy ways are just.
