[2 Nephi 26:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) But behold, the righteous that hearken unto the words of the prophets, and destroy them not, but look forward unto Christ with steadfastness for the signs which are given, notwithstanding all persecution--behold, they are they which shall not perish.
