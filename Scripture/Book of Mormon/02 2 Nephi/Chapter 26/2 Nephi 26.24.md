[2 Nephi 26:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) He doeth not anything save it be for the benefit of the world; for he loveth the world, even that he layeth down his own life that he may draw all men unto him. Wherefore, he commandeth none that they shall not partake of his salvation.
