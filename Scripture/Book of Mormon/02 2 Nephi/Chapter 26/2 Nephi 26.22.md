[2 Nephi 26:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.
