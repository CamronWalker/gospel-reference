[2 Nephi 26:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And when these things have passed away a speedy destruction cometh unto my people; for, notwithstanding the pains of my soul, I have seen it; wherefore, I know that it shall come to pass; and they sell themselves for naught; for, for the reward of their pride and their foolishness they shall reap destruction; for because they yield unto the devil and choose works of darkness rather than light, therefore they must go down to hell.
