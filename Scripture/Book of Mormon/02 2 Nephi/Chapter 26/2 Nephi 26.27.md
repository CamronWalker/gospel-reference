[2 Nephi 26:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Hath he commanded any that they should not partake of his salvation? Behold I say unto you, Nay; but he hath given it free for all men; and he hath commanded his people that they should persuade all men to repentance.
