[2 Nephi 26:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) For thus saith the Lord God: They shall write the things which shall be done among them, and they shall be written and sealed up in a book, and those who have dwindled in unbelief shall not have them, for they seek to destroy the things of God.
