[2 Nephi 15:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/15?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Therefore, as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the chaff, their root shall be rottenness, and their blossoms shall go up as dust; because they have cast away the law of the Lord of Hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
