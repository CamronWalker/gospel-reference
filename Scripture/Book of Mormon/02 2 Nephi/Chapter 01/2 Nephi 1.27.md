[2 Nephi 1:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And it must needs be that the power of God must be with him, even unto his commanding you that ye must obey. But behold, it was not he, but it was the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, which opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it.
