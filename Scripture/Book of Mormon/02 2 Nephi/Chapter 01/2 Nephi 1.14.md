[2 Nephi 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Awake! and arise from the dust, and hear the words of a trembling parent, whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent grave, from whence no traveler can return; a few more days and I go the way of all the earth.
