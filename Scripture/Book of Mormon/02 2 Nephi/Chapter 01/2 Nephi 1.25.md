[2 Nephi 1:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you, lest he shall suffer again; for behold, ye have accused him that he sought power and authority over you; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you, but he hath sought the glory of God, and your own eternal welfare.
