[2 Nephi 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Yea, as one generation passeth to another there shall be bloodsheds, and great visitations among them; wherefore, my sons, I would that ye would remember; yea, I would that ye would hearken unto my words.
