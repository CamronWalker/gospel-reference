[2 Nephi 1:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Wherefore, because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed with his seed, that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land; and nothing, save it shall be iniquity among them, shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever.
