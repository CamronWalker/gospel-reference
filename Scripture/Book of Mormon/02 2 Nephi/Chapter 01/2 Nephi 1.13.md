[2 Nephi 1:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) O that ye would awake; awake from a deep sleep, yea, even from the sleep of hell, and shake off the awful chains by which ye are bound, which are the chains which bind the children of men, that they are carried away captive down to the eternal gulf of misery and woe.
