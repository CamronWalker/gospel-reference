[2 Nephi 1:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you. Ye say that he hath used sharpness; ye say that he hath been angry with you; but behold, his sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God, which was in him; and that which ye call anger was the truth, according to that which is in God, which he could not restrain, manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities.
