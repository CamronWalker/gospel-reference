[2 Nephi 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But, said he, notwithstanding our afflictions, we have obtained a land of promise, a land which is choice above all other lands; a land which the Lord God hath covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed. Yea, the Lord hath covenanted this land unto me, and to my children forever, and also all those who should be led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord.
