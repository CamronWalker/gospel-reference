[2 Nephi 1:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/1?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And now my son, Laman, and also Lemuel and Sam, and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael, behold, if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish. And if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a blessing, yea, even my first blessing.
