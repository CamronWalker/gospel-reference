[2 Nephi 32:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Wherefore, now after I have spoken these words, if ye cannot understand them it will be because ye ask not, neither do ye knock; wherefore, ye are not brought into the light, but must perish in the dark.
