[2 Nephi 32:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.
