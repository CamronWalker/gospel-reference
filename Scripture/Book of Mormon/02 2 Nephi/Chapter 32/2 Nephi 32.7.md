[2 Nephi 32:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And now I, Nephi, cannot say more; the Spirit stoppeth mine utterance, and I am left to mourn because of the unbelief, and the wickedness, and the ignorance, and the stiffneckedness of men; for they will not search knowledge, nor understand great knowledge, when it is given unto them in plainness, even as plain as word can be.
