[2 Nephi 32:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Behold, this is the doctrine of Christ, and there will be no more doctrine given until after he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh. And when he shall manifest himself unto you in the flesh, the things which he shall say unto you shall ye observe to do.
