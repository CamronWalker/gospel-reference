[2 Nephi 32:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Angels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ. Wherefore, I said unto you, feast upon the words of Christ; for behold, the words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.
