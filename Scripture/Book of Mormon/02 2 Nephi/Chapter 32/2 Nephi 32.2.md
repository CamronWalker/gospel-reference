[2 Nephi 32:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/32?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Do ye not remember that I said unto you that after ye had received the Holy Ghost ye could speak with the tongue of angels? And now, how could ye speak with the tongue of angels save it were by the Holy Ghost?
