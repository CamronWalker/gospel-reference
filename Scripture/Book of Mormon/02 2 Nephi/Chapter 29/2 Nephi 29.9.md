[2 Nephi 29:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And I do this that I may prove unto many that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and that I speak forth my words according to mine own pleasure. And because that I have spoken one word ye need not suppose that I cannot speak another; for my work is not yet finished; neither shall it be until the end of man, neither from that time henceforth and forever.
