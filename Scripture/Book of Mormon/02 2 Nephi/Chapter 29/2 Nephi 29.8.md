[2 Nephi 29:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Wherefore murmur ye, because that ye shall receive more of my word? Know ye not that the testimony of two nations is a witness unto you that I am God, that I remember one nation like unto another? Wherefore, I speak the same words unto one nation like unto another. And when the two nations shall run together the testimony of the two nations shall run together also.
