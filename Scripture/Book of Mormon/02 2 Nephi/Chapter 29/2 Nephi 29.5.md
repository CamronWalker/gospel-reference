[2 Nephi 29:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) O ye Gentiles, have ye remembered the Jews, mine ancient covenant people? Nay; but ye have cursed them, and have hated them, and have not sought to recover them. But behold, I will return all these things upon your own heads; for I the Lord have not forgotten my people.
