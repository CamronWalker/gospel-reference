[2 Nephi 29:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/29?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For I command all men, both in the east and in the west, and in the north, and in the south, and in the islands of the sea, that they shall write the words which I speak unto them; for out of the books which shall be written I will judge the world, every man according to their works, according to that which is written.
