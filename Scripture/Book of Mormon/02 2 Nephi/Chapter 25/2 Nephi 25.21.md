[2 Nephi 25:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Wherefore, for this cause hath the Lord God promised unto me that these things which I write shall be kept and preserved, and handed down unto my seed, from generation to generation, that the promise may be fulfilled unto Joseph, that his seed should never perish as long as the earth should stand.
