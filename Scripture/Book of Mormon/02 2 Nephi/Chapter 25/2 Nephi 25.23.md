[2 Nephi 25:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) For we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.
