[2 Nephi 25:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.
