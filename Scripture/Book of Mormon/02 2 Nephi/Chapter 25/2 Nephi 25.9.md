[2 Nephi 25:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And as one generation hath been destroyed among the Jews because of iniquity, even so have they been destroyed from generation to generation according to their iniquities; and never hath any of them been destroyed save it were foretold them by the prophets of the Lord.
