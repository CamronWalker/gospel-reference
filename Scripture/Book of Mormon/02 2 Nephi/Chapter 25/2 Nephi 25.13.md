[2 Nephi 25:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, they will crucify him; and after he is laid in a sepulchre for the space of three days he shall rise from the dead, with healing in his wings; and all those who shall believe on his name shall be saved in the kingdom of God. Wherefore, my soul delighteth to prophesy concerning him, for I have seen his day, and my heart doth magnify his holy name.
