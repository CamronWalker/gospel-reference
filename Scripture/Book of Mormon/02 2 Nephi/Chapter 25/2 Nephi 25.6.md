[2 Nephi 25:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/25?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.
