[2 Nephi 4:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy? [His anger is never mentioned, but he acknowledges that his enemies do make him angry.]
