[2 Nephi 4:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!
