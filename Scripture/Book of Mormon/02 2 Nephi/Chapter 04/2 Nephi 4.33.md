[2 Nephi 4:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way--but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.
