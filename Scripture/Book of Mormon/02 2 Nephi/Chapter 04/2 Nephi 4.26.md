[2 Nephi 4:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions?
