[2 Nephi 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass.
