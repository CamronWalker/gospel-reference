[2 Nephi 4:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.
