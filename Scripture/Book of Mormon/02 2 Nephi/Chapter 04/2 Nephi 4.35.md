[2 Nephi 4:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. <James 1:35> Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.
