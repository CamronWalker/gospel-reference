[2 Nephi 4:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.
