[2 Nephi 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son; behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed.
