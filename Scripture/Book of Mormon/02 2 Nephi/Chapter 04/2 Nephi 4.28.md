[2 Nephi 4:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Awake, my soul!Â [A soul that is awake is one that is ready to receive the Spirit and act upon its promptings.] No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.
