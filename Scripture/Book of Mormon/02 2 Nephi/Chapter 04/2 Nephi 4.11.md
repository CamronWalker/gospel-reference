[2 Nephi 4:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.
