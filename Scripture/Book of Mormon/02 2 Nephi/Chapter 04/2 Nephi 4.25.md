[2 Nephi 4:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been carried away upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them.
