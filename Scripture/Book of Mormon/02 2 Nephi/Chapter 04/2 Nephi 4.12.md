[2 Nephi 4:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had spoken unto all his household, according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried.
