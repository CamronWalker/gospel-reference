[2 Nephi 4:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/4?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.
