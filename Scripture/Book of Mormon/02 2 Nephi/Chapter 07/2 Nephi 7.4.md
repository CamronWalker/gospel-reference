[2 Nephi 7:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/7?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season unto thee, O house of Israel. When ye are weary he waketh morning by morning. He waketh mine ear to hear as the learned.
