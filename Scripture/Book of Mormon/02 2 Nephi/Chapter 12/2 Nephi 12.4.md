[2 Nephi 12:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks--nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
