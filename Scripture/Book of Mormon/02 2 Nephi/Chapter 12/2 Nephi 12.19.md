[2 Nephi 12:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the glory of his majesty shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
