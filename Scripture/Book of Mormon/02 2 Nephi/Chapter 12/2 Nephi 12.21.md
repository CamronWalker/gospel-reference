[2 Nephi 12:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged rocks, for the fear of the Lord shall come upon them and the majesty of his glory shall smite them, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.
