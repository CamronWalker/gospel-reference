[2 Nephi 12:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Therefore, O Lord, thou hast forsaken thy people, the house of Jacob, because they be replenished from the east, and hearken unto soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
