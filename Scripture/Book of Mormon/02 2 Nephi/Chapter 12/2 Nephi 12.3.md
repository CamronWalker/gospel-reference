[2 Nephi 12:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths; for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
