[2 Nephi 27:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Wherefore, when thou hast read the words which I have commanded thee, and obtained the witnesses which I have promised unto thee, then shalt thou seal up the book again, and hide it up unto me, that I may preserve the words which thou hast not read, until I shall see fit in mine own wisdom to reveal all things unto the children of men.
