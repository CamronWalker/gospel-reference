[2 Nephi 27:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the day cometh that the words of the book which were sealed shall be read upon the house tops; and they shall be read by the power of Christ; and all things shall be revealed unto the children of men which ever have been among the children of men, and which ever will be even unto the end of the earth.
