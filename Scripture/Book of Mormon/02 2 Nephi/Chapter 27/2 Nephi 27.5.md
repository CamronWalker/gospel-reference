[2 Nephi 27:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For behold, the Lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep. For behold, ye have closed your eyes, and ye have rejected the prophets; and your rulers, and the seers hath he covered because of your iniquity.
