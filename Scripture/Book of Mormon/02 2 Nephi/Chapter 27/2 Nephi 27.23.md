[2 Nephi 27:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) For behold, I am God; and I am a God of miracles; and I will show unto the world that I am the same yesterday, today, and forever; and I work not among the children of men save it be according to their faith.
