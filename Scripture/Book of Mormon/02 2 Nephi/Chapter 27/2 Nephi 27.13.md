[2 Nephi 27:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/27?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And there is none other which shall view it, save it be a few according to the will of God, to bear testimony of his word unto the children of men; for the Lord God hath said that the words of the faithful should speak as if it were from the dead.
