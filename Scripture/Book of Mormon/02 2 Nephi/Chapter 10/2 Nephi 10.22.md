[2 Nephi 10:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) For behold, the Lord God has led away from time to time from the house of Israel, according to his will and pleasure. And now behold, the Lord remembereth all them who have been broken off, wherefore he remembereth us also.
