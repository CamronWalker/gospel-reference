[2 Nephi 10:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Wherefore, my beloved brethren, thus saith our God: I will afflict thy seed by the hand of the Gentiles; nevertheless, I will soften the hearts of the Gentiles, that they shall be like unto a father to them; wherefore, the Gentiles shall be blessed and numbered among the house of Israel.
