[2 Nephi 10:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) Wherefore, my beloved brethren, reconcile yourselves to the will of God, and not to the will of the devil and the flesh; and remember, after ye are reconciled unto God, that it is only in and through the grace of God that ye are saved.
