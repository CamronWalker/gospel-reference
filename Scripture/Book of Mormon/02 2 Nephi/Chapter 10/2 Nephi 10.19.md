[2 Nephi 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Wherefore, I will consecrate this land unto thy seed, and them who shall be numbered among thy seed, forever, for the land of their inheritance; for it is a choice land, saith God unto me, above all other lands, wherefore I will have all men that dwell thereon that they shall worship me, saith God.
