[2 Nephi 10:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Wherefore, as I said unto you, it must needs be expedient that Christ--for in the last night the angel spake unto me that this should be his name--should come among the Jews, among those who are the more wicked part of the world; and they shall crucify him--for thus it behooveth our God, and there is none other nation on earth that would crucify their God.
