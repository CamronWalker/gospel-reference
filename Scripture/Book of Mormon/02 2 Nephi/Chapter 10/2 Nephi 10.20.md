[2 Nephi 10:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And now, my beloved brethren, seeing that our merciful God has given us so great knowledge concerning these things, let us remember him, and lay aside our sins, and not hang down our heads, for we are not cast off; nevertheless, we have been driven out of the land of our inheritance; but we have been led to a better land, for the Lord has made the sea our path, and we are upon an isle of the sea.
