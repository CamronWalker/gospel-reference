[2 Nephi 10:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Wherefore, for this cause, that my covenants may be fulfilled which I have made unto the children of men, that I will do unto them while they are in the flesh, I must needs destroy the secret works of darkness, and of murders, and of abominations.
