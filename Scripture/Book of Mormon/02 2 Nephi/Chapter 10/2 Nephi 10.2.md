[2 Nephi 10:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For behold, the promises which we have obtained are promises unto us according to the flesh; wherefore, as it has been shown unto me that many of our children shall perish in the flesh because of unbelief, nevertheless, God will be merciful unto many; and our children shall be restored, that they may come to that which will give them the true knowledge of their Redeemer.
