[2 Nephi 10:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it shall come to pass that they shall be gathered in from their long dispersion, from the isles of the sea, and from the four parts of the earth; and the nations of the Gentiles shall be great in the eyes of me, saith God, in carrying them forth to the lands of their inheritance.
