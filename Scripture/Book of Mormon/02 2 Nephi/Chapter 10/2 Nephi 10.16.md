[2 Nephi 10:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Wherefore, he that fighteth against Zion, both Jew and Gentile, both bond and free, both male and female, shall perish; for they are they who are the whore of all the earth; for they who are not for me are against me, saith our God.
