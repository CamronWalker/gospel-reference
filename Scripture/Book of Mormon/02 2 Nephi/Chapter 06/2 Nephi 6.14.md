[2 Nephi 6:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time to recover them; wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believe in him.
