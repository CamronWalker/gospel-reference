[2 Nephi 6:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.
