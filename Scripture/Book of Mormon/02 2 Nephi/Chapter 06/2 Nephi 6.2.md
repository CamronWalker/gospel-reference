[2 Nephi 6:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the manner of his holy order, and having been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.
