[2 Nephi 6:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they who wait for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.
