[2 Nephi 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words of my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written, from the creation of the world.
