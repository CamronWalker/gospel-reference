[2 Nephi 6:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
