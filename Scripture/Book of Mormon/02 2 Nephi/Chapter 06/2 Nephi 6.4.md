[2 Nephi 6:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother has desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.
