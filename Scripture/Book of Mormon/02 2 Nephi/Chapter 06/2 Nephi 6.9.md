[2 Nephi 6:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should return again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge him and crucify him, according to the words of the angel who spake it unto me.
