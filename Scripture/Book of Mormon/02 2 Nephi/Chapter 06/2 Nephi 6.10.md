[2 Nephi 6:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/6?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And after they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that they shall be smitten and afflicted.
