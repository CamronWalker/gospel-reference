[Jacob 6:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And how merciful is our God unto us, for he remembereth the house of Israel, both roots and branches; and he stretches forth his hands unto them all the day long; and they are a stiffnecked and a gainsaying people; but as many as will not harden their hearts shall be saved in the kingdom of God.
