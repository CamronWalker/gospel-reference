[Jacob 6:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you. And while his arm of mercy is extended towards you in the light of the day, harden not your hearts.
