[Jacob 6:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Behold, will ye reject these words? Will ye reject the words of the prophets; and will ye reject all the words which have been spoken concerning Christ, after so many have spoken concerning him; and deny the good word of Christ, and the power of God, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and quench the Holy Spirit, and make a mock of the great plan of redemption, which hath been laid for you?
