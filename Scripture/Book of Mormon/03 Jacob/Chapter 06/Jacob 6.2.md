[Jacob 6:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.
