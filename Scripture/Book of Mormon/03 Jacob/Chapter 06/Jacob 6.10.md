[Jacob 6:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/6?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And according to the power of justice, for justice cannot be denied, ye must go away into that lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever, which lake of fire and brimstone is endless torment.
