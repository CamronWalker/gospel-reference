[Jacob 7:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God.
