[Jacob 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them, and they were overcome that they fell to the earth.
