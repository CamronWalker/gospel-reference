[Jacob 7:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And this is not all--it has been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.
