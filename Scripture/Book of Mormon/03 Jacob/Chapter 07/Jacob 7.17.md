[Jacob 7:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.
