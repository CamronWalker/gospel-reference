[Jacob 7:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.
