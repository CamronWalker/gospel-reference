[Jacob 7:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ. And he preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.
