[Jacob 7:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.
