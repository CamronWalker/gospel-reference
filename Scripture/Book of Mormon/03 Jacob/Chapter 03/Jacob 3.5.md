[Jacob 3:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father--that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.
