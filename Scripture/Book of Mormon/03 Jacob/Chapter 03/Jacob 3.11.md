[Jacob 3:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death.
