[Jacob 3:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.
