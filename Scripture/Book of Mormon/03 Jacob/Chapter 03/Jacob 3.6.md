[Jacob 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people.
