[Jacob 3:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) But behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction.
