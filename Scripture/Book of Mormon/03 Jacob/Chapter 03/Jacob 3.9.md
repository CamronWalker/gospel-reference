[Jacob 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.
