[Jacob 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.
