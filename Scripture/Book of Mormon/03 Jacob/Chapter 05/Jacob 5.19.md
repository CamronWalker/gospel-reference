[Jacob 5:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Come, let us go to the nethermost part of the vineyard, and behold if the natural branches of the tree have not brought forth much fruit also, that I may lay up of the fruit thereof against the season, unto mine own self.
