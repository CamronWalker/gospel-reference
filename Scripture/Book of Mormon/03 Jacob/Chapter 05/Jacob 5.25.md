[Jacob 5:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.
