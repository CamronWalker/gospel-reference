[Jacob 5:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard looked and beheld the tree in the which the wild olive branches had been grafted; and it had sprung forth and begun to bear fruit. And he beheld that it was good; and the fruit thereof was like unto the natural fruit.
