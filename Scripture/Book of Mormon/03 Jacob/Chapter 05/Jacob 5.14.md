[Jacob 5:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard went his way, and hid the natural branches of the tame olive-tree in the nethermost parts of the vineyard, some in one and some in another, according to his will and pleasure.
