[Jacob 5:58](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p58#p58) And we will nourish again the trees of the vineyard, and we will trim up the branches thereof; and we will pluck from the trees those branches which are ripened, that must perish, and cast them into the fire.
