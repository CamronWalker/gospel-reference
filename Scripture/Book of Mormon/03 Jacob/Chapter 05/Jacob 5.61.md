[Jacob 5:61](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p61#p61) Wherefore, go to, and call servants, that we may labor diligently with our might in the vineyard, that we may prepare the way, that I may bring forth again the natural fruit, which natural fruit is good and the most precious above all other fruit.
