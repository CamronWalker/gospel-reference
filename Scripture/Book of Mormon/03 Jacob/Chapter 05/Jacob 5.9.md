[Jacob 5:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Take thou the branches of the wild olive-tree, and graft them in, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I will cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my vineyard.
