[Jacob 5:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) Wherefore, let us take of the branches of these which I have planted in the nethermost parts of my vineyard, and let us graft them into the tree from whence they came; and let us pluck from the tree those branches whose fruit is most bitter, and graft in the natural branches of the tree in the stead thereof.
