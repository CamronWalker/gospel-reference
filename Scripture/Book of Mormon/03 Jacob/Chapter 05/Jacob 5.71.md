[Jacob 5:71](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p71#p71) And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.
