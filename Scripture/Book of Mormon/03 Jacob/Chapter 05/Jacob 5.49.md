[Jacob 5:49](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p49#p49) And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Let us go to and hew down the trees of the vineyard and cast them into the fire, that they shall not cumber the ground of my vineyard, for I have done all. What could I have done more for my vineyard?
