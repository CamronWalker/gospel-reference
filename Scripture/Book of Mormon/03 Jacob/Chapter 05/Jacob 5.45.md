[Jacob 5:45](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p45#p45) And thou beheldest that a part thereof brought forth good fruit, and a part thereof brought forth wild fruit; and because I plucked not the branches thereof and cast them into the fire, behold, they have overcome the good branch that it hath withered away.
