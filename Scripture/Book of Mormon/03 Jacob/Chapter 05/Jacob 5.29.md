[Jacob 5:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And it came to pass that a long time had passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor again in the vineyard. For behold, the time draweth near, and the end soon cometh; wherefore, I must lay up fruit against the season, unto mine own self.
