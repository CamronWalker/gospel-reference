[Jacob 5:77](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p77#p77) And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into its own place. And then cometh the season and the end; and my vineyard will I cause to be burned with fire.
