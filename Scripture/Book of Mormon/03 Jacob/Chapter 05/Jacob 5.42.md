[Jacob 5:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) Behold, I knew that all the fruit of the vineyard, save it were these, had become corrupted. And now these which have once brought forth good fruit have also become corrupted; and now all the trees of my vineyard are good for nothing save it be to be hewn down and cast into the fire.
