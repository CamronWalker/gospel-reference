[Jacob 5:76](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p76#p76) For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that which I have spoken.
