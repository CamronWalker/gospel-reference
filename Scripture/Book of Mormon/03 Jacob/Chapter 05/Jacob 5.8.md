[Jacob 5:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.
