[Jacob 5:63](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p63#p63) Graft in the branches; begin at the last that they may be first, and that the first may be last, and dig about the trees, both old and young, the first and the last; and the last and the first, that all may be nourished once again for the last time.
