[Jacob 5:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard and the servant went down into the vineyard; and they came to the tree whose natural branches had been broken off, and the wild branches had been grafted in; and behold all sorts of fruit did cumber the tree.
