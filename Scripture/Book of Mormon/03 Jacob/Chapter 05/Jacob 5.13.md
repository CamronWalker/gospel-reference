[Jacob 5:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And these will I place in the nethermost part of my vineyard, whithersoever I will, it mattereth not unto thee; and I do it that I may preserve unto myself the natural branches of the tree; and also, that I may lay up fruit thereof against the season, unto myself; for it grieveth me that I should lose this tree and the fruit thereof.
