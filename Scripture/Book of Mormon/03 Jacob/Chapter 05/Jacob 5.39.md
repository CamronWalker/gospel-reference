[Jacob 5:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/5?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And it came to pass that they went down into the nethermost parts of the vineyard. And it came to pass that they beheld that the fruit of the natural branches had become corrupt also; yea, the first and the second and also the last; and they had all become corrupt.
