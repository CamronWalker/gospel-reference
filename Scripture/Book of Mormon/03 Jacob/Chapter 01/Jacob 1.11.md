[Jacob 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Wherefore, the people were desirous to retain in remembrance his name. And whoso should reign in his stead were called by the people, second Nephi, third Nephi, and so forth, according to the reigns of the kings; and thus they were called by the people, let them be of whatever name they would.
