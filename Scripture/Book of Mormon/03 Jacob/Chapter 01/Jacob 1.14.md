[Jacob 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But I, Jacob, shall not hereafter distinguish them by these names, but I shall call them Lamanites that seek to destroy the people of Nephi, and those who are friendly to Nephi I shall call Nephites, or the people of Nephi, according to the reigns of the kings.
