[Jacob 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness.
