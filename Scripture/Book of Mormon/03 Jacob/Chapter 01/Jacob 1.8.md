[Jacob 1:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/1?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.
