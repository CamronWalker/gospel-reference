[Jacob 2:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) For they shall not lead away captive the daughters of my people because of their tenderness, save I shall visit them with a sore curse, even unto destruction; for they shall not commit whoredoms, like unto them of old, saith the Lord of Hosts.
