[Jacob 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Wherefore, I must tell you the truth according to the plainness of the word of God. For behold, as I inquired of the Lord, thus came the word unto me, saying: Jacob, get thou up into the temple on the morrow, and declare the word which I shall give thee unto this people.
