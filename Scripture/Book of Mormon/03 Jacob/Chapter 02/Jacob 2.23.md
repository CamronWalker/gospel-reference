[Jacob 2:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.
