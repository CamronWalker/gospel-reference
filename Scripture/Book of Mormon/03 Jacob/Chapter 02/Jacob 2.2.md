[Jacob 2:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Now, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, according to the responsibility which I am under to God, to magnify mine office with soberness, and that I might rid my garments of your sins, I come up into the temple this day that I might declare unto you the word of God.
