[Jacob 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And after ye have obtained a hope in Christ ye shall obtain riches, if ye seek them; and ye will seek them for the intent to do good--to clothe the naked, and to feed the hungry, and to liberate the captive, and administer relief to the sick and the afflicted.
