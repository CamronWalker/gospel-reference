[Jacob 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But behold, hearken ye unto me, and know that by the help of the all-powerful Creator of heaven and earth I can tell you concerning your thoughts, how that ye are beginning to labor in sin, which sin appeareth very abominable unto me, yea, and abominable unto God.
