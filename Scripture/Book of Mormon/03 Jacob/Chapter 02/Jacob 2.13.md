[Jacob 2:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And the hand of providence hath smiled upon you most pleasingly, that you have obtained many riches; and because some of you have obtained more abundantly than that of your brethren ye are lifted up in the pride of your hearts, and wear stiff necks and high heads because of the costliness of your apparel, and persecute your brethren because ye suppose that ye are better than they.
