[Jacob 4:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.
