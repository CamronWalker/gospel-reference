[Jacob 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?
