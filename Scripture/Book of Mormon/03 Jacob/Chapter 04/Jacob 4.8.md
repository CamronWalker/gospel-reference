[Jacob 4:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.
