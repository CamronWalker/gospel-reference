[Jacob 4:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.
