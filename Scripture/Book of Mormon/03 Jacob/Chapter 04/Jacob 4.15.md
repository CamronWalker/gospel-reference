[Jacob 4:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation.
