[Jacob 4:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/4?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.
