[Alma 10:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices--yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.
