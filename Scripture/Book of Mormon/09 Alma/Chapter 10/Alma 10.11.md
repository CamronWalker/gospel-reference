[Alma 10:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.
