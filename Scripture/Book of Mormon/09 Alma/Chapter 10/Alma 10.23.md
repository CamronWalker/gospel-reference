[Alma 10:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.
