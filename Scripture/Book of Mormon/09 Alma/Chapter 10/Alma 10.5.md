[Alma 10:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.
