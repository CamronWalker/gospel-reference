[Alma 10:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house--and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.
