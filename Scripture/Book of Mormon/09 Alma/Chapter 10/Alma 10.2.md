[Alma 10:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was the same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.
