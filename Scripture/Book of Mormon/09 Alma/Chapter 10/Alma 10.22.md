[Alma 10:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/10?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.
