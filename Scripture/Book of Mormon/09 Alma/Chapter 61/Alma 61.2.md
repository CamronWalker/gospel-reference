[Alma 61:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.
