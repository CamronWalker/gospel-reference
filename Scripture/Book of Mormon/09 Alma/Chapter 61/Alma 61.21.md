[Alma 61:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) See that ye strengthen Lehi and Teancum in the Lord; tell them to fear not, for God will deliver them, yea, and also all those who stand fast in that liberty wherewith God hath made them free. And now I close mine epistle to my beloved brother, Moroni.
