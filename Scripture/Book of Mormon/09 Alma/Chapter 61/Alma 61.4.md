[Alma 61:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.
