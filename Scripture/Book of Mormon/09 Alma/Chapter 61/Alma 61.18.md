[Alma 61:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/61?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And we will take possession of the city of Zarahemla, that we may obtain more food to send forth unto Lehi and Teancum; yea, we will go forth against them in the strength of the Lord, and we will put an end to this great iniquity.
