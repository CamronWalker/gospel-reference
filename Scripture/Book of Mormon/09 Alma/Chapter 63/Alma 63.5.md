[Alma 63:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/63?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that Hagoth, he being an exceedingly curious man, therefore he went forth and built him an exceedingly large ship, on the borders of the land Bountiful, by the land Desolation, and launched it forth into the west sea, by the narrow neck which led into the land northward.
