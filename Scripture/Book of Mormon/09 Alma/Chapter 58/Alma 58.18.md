[Alma 58:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come out with their numerous army against us. And when they had come and were about to fall upon us with the sword, I caused that my men, those who were with me, should retreat into the wilderness.
