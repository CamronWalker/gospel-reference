[Alma 58:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla.
