[Alma 58:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And it came to pass that when the armies of the Lamanites did arrive near the city, and saw that we were prepared to meet them, they were astonished exceedingly and struck with great fear, insomuch that they did flee into the wilderness.
