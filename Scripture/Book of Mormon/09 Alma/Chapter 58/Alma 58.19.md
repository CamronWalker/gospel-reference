[Alma 58:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that the Lamanites did follow after us with great speed, for they were exceedingly desirous to overtake us that they might slay us; therefore they did follow us into the wilderness; and we did pass by in the midst of Gid and Teomner, insomuch that they were not discovered by the Lamanites.
