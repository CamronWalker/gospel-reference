[Alma 58:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And those cities which had been taken by the Lamanites, all of them are at this period of time in our possession; and our fathers and our women and our children are returning to their homes, all save it be those who have been taken prisoners and carried off by the Lamanites.
