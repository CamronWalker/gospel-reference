[Alma 58:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And when we saw that they were making preparations to come out against us, behold, I caused that Gid, with a small number of men, should secrete himself in the wilderness, and also that Teomner and a small number of men should secrete themselves also in the wilderness.
