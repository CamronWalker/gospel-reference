[Alma 58:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And when the Lamanites saw that they were marching towards the land of Zarahemla, they were exceedingly afraid, lest there was a plan laid to lead them on to destruction; therefore they began to retreat into the wilderness again, yea, even back by the same way which they had come.
