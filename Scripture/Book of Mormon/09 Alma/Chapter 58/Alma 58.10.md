[Alma 58:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.
