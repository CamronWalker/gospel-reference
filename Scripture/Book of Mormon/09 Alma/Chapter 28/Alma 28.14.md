[Alma 28:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/28?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing--sorrow because of death and destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ unto life.
