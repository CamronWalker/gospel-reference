[Alma 28:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/28?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Yea, the cry of widows mourning for their husbands, and also of fathers mourning for their sons, and the daughter for the brother, yea, the brother for the father; and thus the cry of mourning was heard among all of them, mourning for their kindred who had been slain.
