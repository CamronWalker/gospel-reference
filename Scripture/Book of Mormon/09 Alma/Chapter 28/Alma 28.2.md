[Alma 28:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/28?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never had been known among all the people in the land from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad.
