[Alma 28:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/28?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever.
