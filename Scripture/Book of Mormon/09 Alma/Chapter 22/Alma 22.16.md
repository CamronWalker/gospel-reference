[Alma 22:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.
