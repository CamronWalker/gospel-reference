[Alma 22:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.
