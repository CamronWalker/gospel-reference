[Alma 22:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were dead.
