[Alma 22:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun the land northward.
