[Alma 22:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And they came from there up into the south wilderness. Thus the land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food.
