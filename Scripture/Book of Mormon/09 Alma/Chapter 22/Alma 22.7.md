[Alma 22:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe.
