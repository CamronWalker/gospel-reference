[Alma 22:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her. And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.
