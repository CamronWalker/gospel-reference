[Alma 22:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/22?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them.
