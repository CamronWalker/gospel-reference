[Alma 18:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.
