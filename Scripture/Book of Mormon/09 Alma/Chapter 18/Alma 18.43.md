[Alma 18:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss.
