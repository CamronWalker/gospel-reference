[Alma 18:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man. Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?
