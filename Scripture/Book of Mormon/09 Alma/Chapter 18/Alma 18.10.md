[Alma 18:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.
