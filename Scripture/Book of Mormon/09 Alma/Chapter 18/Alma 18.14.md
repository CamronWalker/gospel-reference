[Alma 18:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.
