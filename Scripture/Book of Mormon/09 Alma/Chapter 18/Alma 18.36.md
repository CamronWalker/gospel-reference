[Alma 18:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.
