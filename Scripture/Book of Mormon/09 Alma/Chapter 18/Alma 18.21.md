[Alma 18:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.
