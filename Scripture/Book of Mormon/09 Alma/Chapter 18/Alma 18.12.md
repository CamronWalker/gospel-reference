[Alma 18:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/18?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.
