[Alma 20:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.
