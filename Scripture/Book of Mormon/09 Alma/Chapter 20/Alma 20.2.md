[Alma 20:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.
