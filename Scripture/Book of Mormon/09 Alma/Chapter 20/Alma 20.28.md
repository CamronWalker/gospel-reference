[Alma 20:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/20?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni. And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were brought forth out of prison.
