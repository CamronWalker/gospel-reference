[Alma 51:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/51?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven.
