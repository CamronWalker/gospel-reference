[Alma 51:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/51?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.
