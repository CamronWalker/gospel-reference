[Alma 51:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/51?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites.
