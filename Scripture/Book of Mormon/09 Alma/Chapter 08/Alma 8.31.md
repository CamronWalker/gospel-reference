[Alma 8:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.
