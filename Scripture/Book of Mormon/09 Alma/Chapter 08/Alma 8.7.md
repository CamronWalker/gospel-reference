[Alma 8:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.
