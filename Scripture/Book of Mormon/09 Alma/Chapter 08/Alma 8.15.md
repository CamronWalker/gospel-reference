[Alma 8:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.
