[Alma 8:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.
