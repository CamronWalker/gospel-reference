[Alma 8:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying--Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.
