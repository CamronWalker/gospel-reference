[Alma 8:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/8?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.
