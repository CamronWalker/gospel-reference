[Alma 33:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/33?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.
