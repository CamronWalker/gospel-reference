[Alma 33:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/33?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction.
