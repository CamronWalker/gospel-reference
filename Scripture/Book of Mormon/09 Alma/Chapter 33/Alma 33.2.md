[Alma 33:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/33?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.
