[Alma 13:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.
