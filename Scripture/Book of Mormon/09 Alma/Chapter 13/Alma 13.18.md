[Alma 13:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.
