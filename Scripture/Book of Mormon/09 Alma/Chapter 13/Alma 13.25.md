[Alma 13:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon. Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.
