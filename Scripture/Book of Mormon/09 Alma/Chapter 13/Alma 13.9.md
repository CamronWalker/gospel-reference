[Alma 13:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/13?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen.
