[Alma 37:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.
