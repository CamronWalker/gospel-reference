[Alma 37:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.
