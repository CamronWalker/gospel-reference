[Alma 37:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.
