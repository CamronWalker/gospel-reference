[Alma 37:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land--but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.
