[Alma 37:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.
