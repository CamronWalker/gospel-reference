[Alma 37:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.
