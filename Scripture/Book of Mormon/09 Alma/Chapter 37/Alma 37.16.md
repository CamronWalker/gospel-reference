[Alma 37:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.
