[Alma 37:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.
