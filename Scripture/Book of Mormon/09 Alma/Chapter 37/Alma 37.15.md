[Alma 37:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.
