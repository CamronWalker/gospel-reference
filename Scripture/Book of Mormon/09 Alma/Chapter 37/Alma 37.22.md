[Alma 37:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.
