[Alma 37:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.
