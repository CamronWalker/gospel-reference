[Alma 37:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.
