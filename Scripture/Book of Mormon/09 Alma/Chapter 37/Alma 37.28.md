[Alma 37:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.
