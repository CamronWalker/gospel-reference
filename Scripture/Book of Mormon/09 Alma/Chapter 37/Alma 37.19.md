[Alma 37:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And now behold, one purpose hath he fulfilled, even to the restoration of many thousands of the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; and he hath shown forth his power in them, and he will also still show forth his power in them unto future generations; therefore they shall be preserved.
