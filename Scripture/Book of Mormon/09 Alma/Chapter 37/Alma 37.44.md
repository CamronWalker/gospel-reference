[Alma 37:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.
