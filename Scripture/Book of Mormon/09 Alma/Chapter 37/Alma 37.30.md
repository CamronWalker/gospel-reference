[Alma 37:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and secret combinations.
