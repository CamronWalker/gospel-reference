[Alma 27:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.
