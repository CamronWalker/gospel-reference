[Alma 27:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss, were exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could not seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger against their brethren, the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.
