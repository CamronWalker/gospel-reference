[Alma 27:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house. And they went and told the chief judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the Lamanites.
