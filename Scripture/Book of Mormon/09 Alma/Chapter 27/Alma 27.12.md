[Alma 27:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will preserve them.
