[Alma 27:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.
