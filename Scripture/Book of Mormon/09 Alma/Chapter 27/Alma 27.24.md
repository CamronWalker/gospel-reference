[Alma 27:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they may inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their enemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a portion of their substance to assist us that we may maintain our armies.
