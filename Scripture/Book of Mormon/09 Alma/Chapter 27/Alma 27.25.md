[Alma 27:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things. And Alma also related unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.
