[Alma 27:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and their awful wickedness.
