[Alma 27:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until we return; and we will try the hearts of our brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their land.
