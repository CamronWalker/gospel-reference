[Alma 27:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.
