[Alma 1:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.
