[Alma 1:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.
