[Alma 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.
