[Alma 1:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.
