[Alma 1:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/1?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.
