[Alma 3:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/3?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.
