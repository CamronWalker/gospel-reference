[Alma 3:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one.
