[Alma 3:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/3?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.
