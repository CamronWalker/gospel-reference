[Alma 3:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/3?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.
