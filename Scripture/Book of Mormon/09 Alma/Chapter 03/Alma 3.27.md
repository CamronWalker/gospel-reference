[Alma 3:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/3?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges.
