[Alma 3:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/3?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites.
