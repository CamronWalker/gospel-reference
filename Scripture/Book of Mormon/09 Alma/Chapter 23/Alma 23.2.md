[Alma 23:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.
