[Alma 23:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither were any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their cities.
