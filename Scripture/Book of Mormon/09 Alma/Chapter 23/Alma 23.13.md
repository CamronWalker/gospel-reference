[Alma 23:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites.
