[Alma 34:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.
