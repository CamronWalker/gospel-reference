[Alma 34:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.
