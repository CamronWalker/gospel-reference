[Alma 34:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;
