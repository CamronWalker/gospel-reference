[Alma 34:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.
