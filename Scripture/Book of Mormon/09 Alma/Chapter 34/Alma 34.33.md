[Alma 34:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.
