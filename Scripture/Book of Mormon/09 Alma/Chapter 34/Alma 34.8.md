[Alma 34:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.
