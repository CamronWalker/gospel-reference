[Alma 34:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.
