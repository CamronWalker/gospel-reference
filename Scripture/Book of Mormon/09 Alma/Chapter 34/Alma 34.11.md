[Alma 34:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.
