[Alma 34:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.
