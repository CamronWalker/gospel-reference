[Alma 34:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing.
