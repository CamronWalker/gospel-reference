[Alma 34:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.
