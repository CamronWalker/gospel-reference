[Alma 5:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Have ye walked, keeping yourselves blameless before God? Could ye say, if ye were called to die at this time, within yourselves, that ye have been sufficiently humble? That your garments have been cleansed and made white through the blood of Christ, who will come to redeem his people from their sins?
