[Alma 5:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) Behold, I say unto you, that the good shepherd doth call you; yea, and in his own name he doth call you, which is the name of Christ; and if ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd, to the name by which ye are called, behold, ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd.
