[Alma 5:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) Therefore, if a man bringeth forth good works he hearkeneth unto the voice of the good shepherd, and he doth follow him; but whosoever bringeth forth evil works, the same becometh a child of the devil, for he hearkeneth unto his voice, and doth follow him.
