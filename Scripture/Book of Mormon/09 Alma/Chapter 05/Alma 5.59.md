[Alma 5:59](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p59#p59) For what shepherd is there among you having many sheep doth not watch over them, that the wolves enter not and devour his flock? And behold, if a wolf enter his flock doth he not drive him out? Yea, and at the last, if he can, he will destroy him.
