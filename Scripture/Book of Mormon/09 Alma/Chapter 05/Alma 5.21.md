[Alma 5:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should come to redeem his people from their sins.
