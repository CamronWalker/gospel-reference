[Alma 5:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And now if ye are not the sheep of the good shepherd, of what fold are ye? Behold, I say unto you, that the devil is your shepherd, and ye are of his fold; and now, who can deny this? Behold, I say unto you, whosoever denieth this is a liar and a child of the devil.
