[Alma 5:58](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p58#p58) For the names of the righteous shall be written in the book of life, and unto them will I grant an inheritance at my right hand. And now, my brethren, what have ye to say against this? I say unto you, if ye speak against it, it matters not, for the word of God must be fulfilled.
