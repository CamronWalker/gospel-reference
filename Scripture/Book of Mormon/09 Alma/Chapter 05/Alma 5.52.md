[Alma 5:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And again I say unto you, the Spirit saith: Behold, the ax is laid at the root of the tree; therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit shall be hewn down and cast into the fire, yea, a fire which cannot be consumed, even an unquenchable fire. Behold, and remember, the Holy One hath spoken it.
