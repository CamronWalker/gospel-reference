[Alma 5:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) I say unto you, Nay; except ye make our Creator a liar from the beginning, or suppose that he is a liar from the beginning, ye cannot suppose that such can have place in the kingdom of heaven; but they shall be cast out for they are the children of the kingdom of the devil.
