[Alma 5:62](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p62#p62) I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.
