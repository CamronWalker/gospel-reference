[Alma 5:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Do ye exercise faith in the redemption of him who created you? Do you look forward with an eye of faith, and view this mortal body raised in immortality, and this corruption raised in incorruption, to stand before God to be judged according to the deeds which have been done in the mortal body?
