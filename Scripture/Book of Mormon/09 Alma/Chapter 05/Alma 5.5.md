[Alma 5:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.
