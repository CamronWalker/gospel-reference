[Alma 5:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.
