[Alma 5:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) And now, my brethren, I would that ye should hear me, for I speak in the energy of my soul; for behold, I have spoken unto you plainly that ye cannot err, or have spoken according to the commandments of God.
