[Alma 5:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?
