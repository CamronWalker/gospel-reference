[Alma 5:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Behold, are ye stripped of pride? I say unto you, if ye are not ye are not prepared to meet God. Behold ye must prepare quickly; for the kingdom of heaven is soon at hand, and such an one hath not eternal life.
