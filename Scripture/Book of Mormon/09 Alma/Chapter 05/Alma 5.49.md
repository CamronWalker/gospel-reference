[Alma 5:49](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p49#p49) And now I say unto you that this is the order after which I am called, yea, to preach unto my beloved brethren, yea, and every one that dwelleth in the land; yea, to preach unto all, both old and young, both bond and free; yea, I say unto you the aged, and also the middle aged, and the rising generation; yea, to cry unto them that they must repent and be born again.
