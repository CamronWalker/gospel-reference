[Alma 5:44](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p44#p44) For I am called to speak after this manner, according to the holy order of God, which is in Christ Jesus; yea, I am commanded to stand and testify unto this people the things which have been spoken by our fathers concerning the things which are to come.
