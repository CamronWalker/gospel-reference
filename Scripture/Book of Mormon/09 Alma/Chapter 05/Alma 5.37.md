[Alma 5:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) O ye workers of iniquity; ye that are puffed up in the vain things of the world, ye that have professed to have known the ways of righteousness nevertheless have gone astray, as sheep having no shepherd, notwithstanding a shepherd hath called after you and is still calling after you, but ye will not hearken unto his voice!
