[Alma 5:46](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p46#p46) Behold, I say unto you they are made known unto me by the Holy Spirit of God. Behold, I have fasted and prayed many days that I might know these things of myself. And now I do know of myself that they are true; for the Lord God hath made them manifest unto me by his Holy Spirit; and this is the spirit of revelation which is in me.
