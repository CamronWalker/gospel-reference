[Alma 5:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And behold, he preached the word unto your fathers, and a mighty change was also wrought in their hearts, and they humbled themselves and put their trust in the true and living God. And behold, they were faithful until the end; therefore they were saved.
