[Alma 25:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And he said unto the priests of Noah that their seed should cause many to be put to death, in the like manner as he was, and that they should be scattered abroad and slain, even as a sheep having no shepherd is driven and slain by wild beasts; and now behold, these words were verified, for they were driven by the Lamanites, and they were hunted, and they were smitten.
