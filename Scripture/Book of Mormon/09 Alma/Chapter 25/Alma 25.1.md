[Alma 25:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And behold, now it came to pass that those Lamanites were more angry because they had slain their brethren; therefore they swore vengeance upon the Nephites; and they did no more attempt to slay the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi at that time.
