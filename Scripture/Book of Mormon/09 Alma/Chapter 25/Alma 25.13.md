[Alma 25:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.
