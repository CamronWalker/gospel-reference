[Alma 25:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/25?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Now this martyrdom caused that many of their brethren should be stirred up to anger; and there began to be contention in the wilderness; and the Lamanites began to hunt the seed of Amulon and his brethren and began to slay them; and they fled into the east wilderness.
