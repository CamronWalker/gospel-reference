[Alma 56:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.
