[Alma 56:56](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p56#p56) But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.
