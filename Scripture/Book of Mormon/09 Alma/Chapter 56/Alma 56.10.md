[Alma 56:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn.
