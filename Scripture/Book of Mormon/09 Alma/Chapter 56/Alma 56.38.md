[Alma 56:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.
