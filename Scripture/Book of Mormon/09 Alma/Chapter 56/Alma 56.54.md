[Alma 56:54](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p54#p54) And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.
