[Alma 56:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.
