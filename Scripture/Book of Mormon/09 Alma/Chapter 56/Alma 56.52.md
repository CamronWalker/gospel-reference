[Alma 56:52](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=p52#p52) And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.
