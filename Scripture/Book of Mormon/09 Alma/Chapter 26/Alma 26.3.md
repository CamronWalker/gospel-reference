[Alma 26:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, I answer for you; for our brethren, the Lamanites, were in darkness, yea, even in the darkest abyss, but behold, how many of them are brought to behold the marvelous light of God! And this is the blessing which hath been bestowed upon us, that we have been made instruments in the hands of God to bring about this great work.
