[Alma 26:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred to sin.
