[Alma 26:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.
