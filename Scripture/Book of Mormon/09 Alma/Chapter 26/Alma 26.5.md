[Alma 26:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Behold, the field was ripe, and blessed are ye, for ye did thrust in the sickle, and did reap with your might, yea, all the day long did ye labor; and behold the number of your sheaves! And they shall be gathered into the garners, that they are not wasted.
