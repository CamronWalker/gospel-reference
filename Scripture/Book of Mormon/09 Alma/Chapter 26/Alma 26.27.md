[Alma 26:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.
