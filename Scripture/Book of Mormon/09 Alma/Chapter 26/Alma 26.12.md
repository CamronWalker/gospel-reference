[Alma 26:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Yea, I know that I am nothing; as to my strength I am weak; therefore I will not boast of myself, but I will boast of my God, for in his strength I can do all things; yea, behold, many mighty miracles we have wrought in this land, for which we will praise his name forever.
