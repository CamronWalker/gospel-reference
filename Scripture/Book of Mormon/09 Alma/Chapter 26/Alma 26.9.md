[Alma 26:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For if we had not come up out of the land of Zarahemla, these our dearly beloved brethren, who have so dearly beloved us, would still have been racked with hatred against us, yea, and they would also have been strangers to God.
