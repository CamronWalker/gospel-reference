[Alma 26:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/26?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Yea, they shall not be beaten down by the storm at the last day; yea, neither shall they be harrowed up by the whirlwinds; but when the storm cometh they shall be gathered together in their place, that the storm cannot penetrate to them; yea, neither shall they be driven with fierce winds whithersoever the enemy listeth to carry them.
