[Alma 6:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God--I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts--the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.
