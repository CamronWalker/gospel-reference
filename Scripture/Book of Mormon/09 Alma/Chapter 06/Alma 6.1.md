[Alma 6:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/6?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.
