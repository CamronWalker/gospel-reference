[Alma 40:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Therefore, there is a time appointed unto men that they shall rise from the dead; and there is a space between the time of death and the resurrection. And now, concerning this space of time, what becometh of the souls of men is the thing which I have inquired diligently of the Lord to know; and this is the thing of which I do know.
