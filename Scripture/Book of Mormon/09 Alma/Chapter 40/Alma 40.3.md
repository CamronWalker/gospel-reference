[Alma 40:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, he bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead. But behold, my son, the resurrection is not yet. Now, I unfold unto you a mystery; nevertheless, there are many mysteries which are kept, that no one knoweth them save God himself. But I show unto you one thing which I have inquired diligently of God that I might know--that is concerning the resurrection.
