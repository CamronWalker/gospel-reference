[Alma 40:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.
