[Alma 40:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.
