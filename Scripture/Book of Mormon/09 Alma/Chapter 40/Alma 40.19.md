[Alma 40:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.
