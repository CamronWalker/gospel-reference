[Alma 40:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.
