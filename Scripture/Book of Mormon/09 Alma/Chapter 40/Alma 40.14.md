[Alma 40:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.
