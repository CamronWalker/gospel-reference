[Alma 40:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Now, whether there shall be one time, or a second time, or a third time, that men shall come forth from the dead, it mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case--that there is a time appointed that all shall rise from the dead.
