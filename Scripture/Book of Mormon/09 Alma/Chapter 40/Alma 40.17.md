[Alma 40:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.
