[Alma 40:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Behold, I say unto you, that there is no resurrection--or, I would say, in other words, that this mortal does not put on immortality, this corruption does not put on incorruption--until after the coming of Christ.
