[Alma 9:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.
