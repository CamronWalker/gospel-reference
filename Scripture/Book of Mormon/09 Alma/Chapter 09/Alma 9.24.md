[Alma 9:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?
