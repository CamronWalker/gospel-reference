[Alma 9:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.
