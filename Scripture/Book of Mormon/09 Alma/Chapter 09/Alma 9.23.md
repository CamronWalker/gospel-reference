[Alma 9:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.
