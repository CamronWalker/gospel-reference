[Alma 9:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all--he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away.
