[Alma 9:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord.
