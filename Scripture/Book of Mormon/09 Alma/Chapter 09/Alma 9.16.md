[Alma 9:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.
