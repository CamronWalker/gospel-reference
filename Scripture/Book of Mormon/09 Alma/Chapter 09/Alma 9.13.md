[Alma 9:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land? And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
