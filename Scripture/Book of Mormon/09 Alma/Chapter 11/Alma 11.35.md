[Alma 11:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people--as though he had authority to command God.
