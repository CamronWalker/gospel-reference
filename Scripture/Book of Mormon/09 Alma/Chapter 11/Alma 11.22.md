[Alma 11:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.
