[Alma 11:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.
