[Alma 11:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?
