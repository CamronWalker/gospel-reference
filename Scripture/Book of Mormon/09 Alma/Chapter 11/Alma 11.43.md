[Alma 11:43](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p43#p43) The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.
