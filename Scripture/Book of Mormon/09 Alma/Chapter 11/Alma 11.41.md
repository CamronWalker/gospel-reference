[Alma 11:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.
