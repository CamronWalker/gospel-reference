[Alma 11:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.
