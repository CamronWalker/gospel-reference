[Alma 41:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.
