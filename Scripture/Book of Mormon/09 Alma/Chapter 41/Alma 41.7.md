[Alma 41:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.
