[Alma 41:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.
