[Alma 41:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.
