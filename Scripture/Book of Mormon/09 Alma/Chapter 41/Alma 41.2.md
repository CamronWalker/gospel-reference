[Alma 41:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.
