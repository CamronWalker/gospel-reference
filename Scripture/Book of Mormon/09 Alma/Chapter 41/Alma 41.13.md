[Alma 41:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish--good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.
