[Alma 41:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.
