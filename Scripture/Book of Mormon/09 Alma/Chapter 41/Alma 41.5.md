[Alma 41:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/41?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.
