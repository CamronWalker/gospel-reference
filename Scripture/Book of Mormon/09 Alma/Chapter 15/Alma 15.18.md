[Alma 15:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.
