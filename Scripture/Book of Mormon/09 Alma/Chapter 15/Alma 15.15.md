[Alma 15:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/15?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.
