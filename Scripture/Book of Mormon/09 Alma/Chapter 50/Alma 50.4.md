[Alma 50:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/50?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.
