[Alma 50:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/50?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon their covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.
