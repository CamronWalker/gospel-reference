[Alma 50:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/50?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.
