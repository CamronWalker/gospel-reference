[Alma 50:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/50?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.
