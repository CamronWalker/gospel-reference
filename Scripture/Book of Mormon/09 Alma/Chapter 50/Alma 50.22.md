[Alma 50:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/50?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.
