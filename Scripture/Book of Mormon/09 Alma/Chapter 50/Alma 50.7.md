[Alma 50:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/50?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.
