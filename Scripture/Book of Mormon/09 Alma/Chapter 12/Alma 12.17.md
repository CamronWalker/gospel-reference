[Alma 12:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.
