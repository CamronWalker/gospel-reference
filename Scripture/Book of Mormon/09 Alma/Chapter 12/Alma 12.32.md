[Alma 12:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God.
