[Alma 12:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.
