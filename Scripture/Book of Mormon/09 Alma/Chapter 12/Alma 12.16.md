[Alma 12:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.
