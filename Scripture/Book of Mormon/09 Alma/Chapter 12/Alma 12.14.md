[Alma 12:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.
