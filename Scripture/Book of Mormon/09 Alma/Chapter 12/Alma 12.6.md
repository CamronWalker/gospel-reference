[Alma 12:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.
