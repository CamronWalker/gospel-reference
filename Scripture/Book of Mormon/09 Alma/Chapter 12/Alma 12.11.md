[Alma 12:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.
