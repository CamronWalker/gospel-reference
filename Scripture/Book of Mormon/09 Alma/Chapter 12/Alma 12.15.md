[Alma 12:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/12?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.
