[Alma 16:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And thus ended the eleventh year of the judges, the Lamanites having been driven out of the land, and the people of Ammonihah were destroyed; yea, every living soul of the Ammonihahites was destroyed, and also their great city, which they said God could not destroy, because of its greatness.
