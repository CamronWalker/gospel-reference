[Alma 16:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.
