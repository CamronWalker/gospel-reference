[Alma 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And now it came to pass, before the Nephites could raise a sufficient army to drive them out of the land, they had destroyed the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, and also some around the borders of Noah, and taken others captive into the wilderness.
