[Alma 16:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord their God.
