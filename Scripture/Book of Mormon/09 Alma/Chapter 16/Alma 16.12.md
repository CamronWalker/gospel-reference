[Alma 16:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/16?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.
