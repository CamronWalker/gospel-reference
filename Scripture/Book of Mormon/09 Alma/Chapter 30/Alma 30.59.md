[Alma 30:59](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p59#p59) And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram--and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.
