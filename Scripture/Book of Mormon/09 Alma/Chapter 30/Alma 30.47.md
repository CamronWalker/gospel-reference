[Alma 30:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.
