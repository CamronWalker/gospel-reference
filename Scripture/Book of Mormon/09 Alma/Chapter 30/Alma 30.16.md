[Alma 30:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Ye look forward and say that ye see a remission of your sins. But behold, it is the effect of a frenzied mind; and this derangement of your minds comes because of the traditions of your fathers, which lead you away into a belief of things which are not so.
