[Alma 30:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.
