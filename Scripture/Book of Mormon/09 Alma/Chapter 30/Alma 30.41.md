[Alma 30:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?
