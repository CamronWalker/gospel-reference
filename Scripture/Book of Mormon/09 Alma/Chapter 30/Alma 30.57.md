[Alma 30:57](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p57#p57) Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.
