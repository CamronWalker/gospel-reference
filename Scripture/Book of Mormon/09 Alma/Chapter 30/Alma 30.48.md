[Alma 30:48](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p48#p48) Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.
