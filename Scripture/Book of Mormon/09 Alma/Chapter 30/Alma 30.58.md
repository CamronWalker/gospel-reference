[Alma 30:58](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p58#p58) And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.
