[Alma 30:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) For there was a law that men should be judged according to their crimes. Nevertheless, there was no law against a man's belief; therefore, a man was punished only for the crimes which he had done; therefore all men were on equal grounds.
