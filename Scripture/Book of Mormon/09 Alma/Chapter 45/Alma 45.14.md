[Alma 45:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/45?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and shall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites pursue even until they shall become extinct. And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.
