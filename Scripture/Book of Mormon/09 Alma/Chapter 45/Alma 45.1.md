[Alma 45:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/45?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.
