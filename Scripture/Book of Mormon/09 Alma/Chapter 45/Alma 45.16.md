[Alma 45:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/45?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And he said: Thus saith the Lord God--Cursed shall be the land, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing and the blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.
