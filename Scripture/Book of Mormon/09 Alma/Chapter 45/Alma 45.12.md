[Alma 45:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/45?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the fourth generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.
