[Alma 36:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.
