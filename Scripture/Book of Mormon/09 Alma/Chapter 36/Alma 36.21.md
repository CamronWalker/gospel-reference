[Alma 36:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.
