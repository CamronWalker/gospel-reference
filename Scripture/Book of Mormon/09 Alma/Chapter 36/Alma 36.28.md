[Alma 36:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time.
