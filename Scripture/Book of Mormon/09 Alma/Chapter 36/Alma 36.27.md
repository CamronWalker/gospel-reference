[Alma 36:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.
