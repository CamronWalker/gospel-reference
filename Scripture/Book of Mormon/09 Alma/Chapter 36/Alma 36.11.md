[Alma 36:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the angel spake more things unto me, which were heard by my brethren, but I did not hear them; for when I heard the words--If thou wilt be destroyed of thyself, seek no more to destroy the church of God--I was struck with such great fear and amazement lest perhaps I should be destroyed, that I fell to the earth and I did hear no more.
