[Alma 36:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And now, O my son Helaman, behold, thou art in thy youth, and therefore, I beseech of thee that thou wilt hear my words and learn of me; for I do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day.
