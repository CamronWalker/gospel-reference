[Alma 36:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that as I was thus racked with torment, while I was harrowed up by the memory of my many sins, behold, I remembered also to have heard my father prophesy unto the people concerning the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world.
