[Alma 36:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) I would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.
