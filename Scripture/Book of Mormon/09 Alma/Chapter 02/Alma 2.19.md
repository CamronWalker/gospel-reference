[Alma 2:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/2?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.
