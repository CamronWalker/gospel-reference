[Alma 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.
