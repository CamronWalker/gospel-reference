[Alma 2:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/2?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.
