[Alma 21:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of God.
