[Alma 21:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest thou that we have cause to repent? How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people? Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We do believe that God will save all men.
