[Alma 21:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to preach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues after the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.
