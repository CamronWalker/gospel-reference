[Alma 21:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest any such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions. We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.
