[Alma 21:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their abominations.
