[Alma 21:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the words which they taught.
