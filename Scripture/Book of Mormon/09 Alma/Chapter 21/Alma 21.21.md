[Alma 21:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/21?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things. And he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him, and that they were a free people, that they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round about.
