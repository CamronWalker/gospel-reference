[Alma 59:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/59?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into the hands of the Lamanites than to retake it from them, he supposed that they would easily maintain that city.
