[Alma 14:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.
