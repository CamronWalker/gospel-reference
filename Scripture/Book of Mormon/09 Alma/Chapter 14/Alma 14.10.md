[Alma 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.
