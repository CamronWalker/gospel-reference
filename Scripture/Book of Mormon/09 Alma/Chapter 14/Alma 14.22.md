[Alma 14:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.
