[Alma 14:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.
