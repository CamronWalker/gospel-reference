[Alma 14:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver yourselves?
