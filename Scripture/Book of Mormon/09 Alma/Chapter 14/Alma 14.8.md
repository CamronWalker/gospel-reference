[Alma 14:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire.
