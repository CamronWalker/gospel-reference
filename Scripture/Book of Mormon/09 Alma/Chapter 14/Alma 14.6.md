[Alma 14:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.
