[Alma 14:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/14?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.
