[Alma 7:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Behold my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.
