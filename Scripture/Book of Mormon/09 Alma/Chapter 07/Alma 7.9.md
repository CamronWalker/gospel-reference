[Alma 7:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying--Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.
