[Alma 7:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.
