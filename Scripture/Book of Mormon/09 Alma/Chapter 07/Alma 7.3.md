[Alma 7:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.
