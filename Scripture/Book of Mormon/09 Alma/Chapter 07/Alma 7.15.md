[Alma 7:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.
