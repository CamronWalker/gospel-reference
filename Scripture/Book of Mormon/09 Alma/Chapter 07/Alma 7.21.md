[Alma 7:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.
