[Alma 7:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.
