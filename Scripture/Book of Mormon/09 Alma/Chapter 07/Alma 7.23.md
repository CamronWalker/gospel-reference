[Alma 7:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.
