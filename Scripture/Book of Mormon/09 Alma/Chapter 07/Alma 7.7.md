[Alma 7:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all--for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.
