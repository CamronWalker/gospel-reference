[Alma 7:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.
