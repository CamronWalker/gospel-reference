[Alma 54:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of Amalickiah whom ye have murdered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings.
