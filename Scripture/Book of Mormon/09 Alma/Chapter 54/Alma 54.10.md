[Alma 54:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and the cause of our God.
