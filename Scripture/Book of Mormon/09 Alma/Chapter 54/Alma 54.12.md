[Alma 54:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth.
