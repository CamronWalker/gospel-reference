[Alma 54:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of God, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi.
