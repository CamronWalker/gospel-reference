[Alma 54:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject yourselves to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down their weapons and shall be at war no more.
