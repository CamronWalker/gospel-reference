[Alma 54:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves. But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first inheritance.
