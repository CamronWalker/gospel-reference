[Alma 54:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But behold these things matter not.
