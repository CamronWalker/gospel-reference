[Alma 54:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/54?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.
