[Alma 62:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death.
