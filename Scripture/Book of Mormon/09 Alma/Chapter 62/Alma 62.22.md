[Alma 62:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies.
