[Alma 62:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.
