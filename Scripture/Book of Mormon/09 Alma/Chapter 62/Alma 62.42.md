[Alma 62:42](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&id=p42#p42) And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those parts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the people of Nephi.
