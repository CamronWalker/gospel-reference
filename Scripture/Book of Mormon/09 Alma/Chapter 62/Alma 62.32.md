[Alma 62:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And it came to pass that Moroni and his army did pursue them from city to city, until they were met by Lehi and Teancum; and the Lamanites fled from Lehi and Teancum, even down upon the borders by the seashore, until they came to the land of Moroni.
