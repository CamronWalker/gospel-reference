[Alma 62:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/62?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land of Nephihah. And it came to pass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.
