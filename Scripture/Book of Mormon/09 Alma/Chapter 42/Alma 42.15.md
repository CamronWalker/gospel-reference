[Alma 42:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.
