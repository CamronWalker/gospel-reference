[Alma 42:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.
