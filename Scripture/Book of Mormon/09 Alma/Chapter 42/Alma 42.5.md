[Alma 42:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.
