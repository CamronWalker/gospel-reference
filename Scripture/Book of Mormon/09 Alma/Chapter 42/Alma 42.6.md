[Alma 42:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) But behold, it was appointed unto man to die--therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth--and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.
