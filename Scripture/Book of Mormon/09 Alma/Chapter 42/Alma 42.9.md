[Alma 42:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.
