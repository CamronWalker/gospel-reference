[Alma 42:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.
