[Alma 42:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.
