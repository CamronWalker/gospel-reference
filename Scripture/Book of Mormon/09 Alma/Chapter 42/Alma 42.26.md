[Alma 42:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.
