[Alma 42:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.
