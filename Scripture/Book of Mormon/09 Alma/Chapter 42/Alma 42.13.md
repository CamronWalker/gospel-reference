[Alma 42:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.
