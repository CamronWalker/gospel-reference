[Alma 43:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) And they were pursued by Lehi and his men; and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon, and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon that they should not cross.
