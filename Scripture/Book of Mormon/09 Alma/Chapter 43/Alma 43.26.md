[Alma 43:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land should gather themselves together to battle against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites.
