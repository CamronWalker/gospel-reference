[Alma 43:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma, and Alma informed the messengers of Moroni, that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the weaker part of the people. And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.
