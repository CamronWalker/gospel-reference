[Alma 43:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all Amalekites and Zoramites.
