[Alma 43:50](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p50#p50) And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled even to the waters of Sidon.
