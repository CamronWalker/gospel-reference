[Alma 43:47](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p47#p47) And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.
