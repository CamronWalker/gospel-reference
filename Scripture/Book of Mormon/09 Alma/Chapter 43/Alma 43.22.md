[Alma 43:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Behold, now it came to pass that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone.
