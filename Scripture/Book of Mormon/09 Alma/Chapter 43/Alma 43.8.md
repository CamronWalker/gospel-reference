[Alma 43:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage.
