[Alma 43:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon--and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a covenant and they would not break it--therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed.
