[Alma 43:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means a part of the Lamanites should come into that land and take possession of the city, took the remaining part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti.
