[Alma 43:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/43?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.
