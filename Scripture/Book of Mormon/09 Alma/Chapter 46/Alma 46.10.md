[Alma 46:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake.
