[Alma 46:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom.
