[Alma 46:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south--A chosen land, and the land of liberty.
