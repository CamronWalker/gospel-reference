[Alma 46:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/46?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.
