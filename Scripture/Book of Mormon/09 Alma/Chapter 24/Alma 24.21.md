[Alma 24:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.
