[Alma 24:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land.
