[Alma 24:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.
