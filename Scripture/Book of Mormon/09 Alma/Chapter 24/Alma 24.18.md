[Alma 24:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.
