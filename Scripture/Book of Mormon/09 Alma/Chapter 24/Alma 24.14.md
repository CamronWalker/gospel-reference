[Alma 24:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.
