[Alma 24:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.
