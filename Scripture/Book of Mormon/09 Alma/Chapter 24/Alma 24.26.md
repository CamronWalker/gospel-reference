[Alma 24:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved.
