[Alma 24:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.
