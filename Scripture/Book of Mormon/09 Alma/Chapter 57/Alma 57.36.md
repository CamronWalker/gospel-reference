[Alma 57:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God.
