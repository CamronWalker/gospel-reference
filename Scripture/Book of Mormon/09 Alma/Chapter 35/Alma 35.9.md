[Alma 35:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And he breathed out many threatenings against them. And now the people of Ammon did not fear their words; therefore they did not cast them out, but they did receive all the poor of the Zoramites that came over unto them; and they did nourish them, and did clothe them, and did give unto them lands for their inheritance; and they did administer unto them according to their wants.
