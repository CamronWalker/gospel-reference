[Alma 35:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that after they had found out the minds of all the people, those who were in favor of the words which had been spoken by Alma and his brethren were cast out of the land; and they were many; and they came over also into the land of Jershon.
