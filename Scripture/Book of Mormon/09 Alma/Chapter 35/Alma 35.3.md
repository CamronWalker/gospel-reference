[Alma 35:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/35?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it came to pass that after the more popular part of the Zoramites had consulted together concerning the words which had been preached unto them, they were angry because of the word, for it did destroy their craft; therefore they would not hearken unto the words.
