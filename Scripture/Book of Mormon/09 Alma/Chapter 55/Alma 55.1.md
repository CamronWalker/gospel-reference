[Alma 55:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/55?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) Now it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against the people of Nephi.
