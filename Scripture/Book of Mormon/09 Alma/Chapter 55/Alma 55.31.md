[Alma 55:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/55?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God in this their time of affliction. They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.
