[Alma 55:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/55?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.
