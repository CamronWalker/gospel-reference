[Alma 39:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.
