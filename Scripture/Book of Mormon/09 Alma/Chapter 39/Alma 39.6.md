[Alma 39:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) For behold, if ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once has had place in you, and ye know that ye deny it, behold, this is a sin which is unpardonable; yea, and whosoever murdereth against the light and knowledge of God, it is not easy for him to obtain forgiveness; yea, I say unto you, my son, that it is not easy for him to obtain a forgiveness.
