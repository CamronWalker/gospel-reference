[Alma 39:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And I command you to take it upon you to counsel with your elder brothers in your undertakings; for behold, thou art in thy youth, and ye stand in need to be nourished by your brothers. And give heed to their counsel.
