[Alma 39:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Suffer not yourself to be led away by any vain or foolish thing; suffer not the devil to lead away your heart again after those wicked harlots. Behold, O my son, how great iniquity ye brought upon the Zoramites; for when they saw your conduct they would not believe in my words.
