[Alma 39:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) That ye turn to the Lord with all your mind, might, and strength; that ye lead away the hearts of no more to do wickedly; but rather return unto them, and acknowledge your faults and that wrong which ye have done.
