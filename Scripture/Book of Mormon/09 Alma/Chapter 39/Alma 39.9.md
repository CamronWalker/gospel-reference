[Alma 39:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/39?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.
