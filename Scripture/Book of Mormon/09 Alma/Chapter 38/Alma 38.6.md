[Alma 38:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things.
