[Alma 38:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.
