[Alma 38:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Do not say: O God, I thank thee that we are better than our brethren; but rather say: O Lord, forgive my unworthiness, and remember my brethren in mercy--yea, acknowledge your unworthiness before God at all times.
