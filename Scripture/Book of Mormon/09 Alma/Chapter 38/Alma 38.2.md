[Alma 38:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.
