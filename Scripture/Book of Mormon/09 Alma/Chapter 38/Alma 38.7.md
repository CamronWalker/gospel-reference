[Alma 38:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.
