[Alma 38:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.
