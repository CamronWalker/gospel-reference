[Alma 38:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) My son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.
