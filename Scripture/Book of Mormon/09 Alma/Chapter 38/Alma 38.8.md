[Alma 38:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins. But behold, I did cry unto him and I did find peace to my soul.
