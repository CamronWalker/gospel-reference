[Alma 38:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And now, my son, I have told you this that ye may learn wisdom, that ye may learn of me that there is no other way or means whereby man can be saved, only in and through Christ. Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.
