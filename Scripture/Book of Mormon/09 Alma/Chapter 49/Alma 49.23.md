[Alma 49:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.
