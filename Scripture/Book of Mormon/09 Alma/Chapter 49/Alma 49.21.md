[Alma 49:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter.
