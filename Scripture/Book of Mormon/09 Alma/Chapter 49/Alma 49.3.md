[Alma 49:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them.
