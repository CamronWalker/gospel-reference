[Alma 49:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows.
