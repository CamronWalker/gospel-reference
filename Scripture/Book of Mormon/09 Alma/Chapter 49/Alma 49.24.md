[Alma 49:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/49?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.
