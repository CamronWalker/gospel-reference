[Alma 17:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.
