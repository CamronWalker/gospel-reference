[Alma 17:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.
