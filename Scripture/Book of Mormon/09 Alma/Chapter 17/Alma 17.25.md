[Alma 17:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.
