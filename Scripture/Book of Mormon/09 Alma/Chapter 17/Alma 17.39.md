[Alma 17:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which they had done.
