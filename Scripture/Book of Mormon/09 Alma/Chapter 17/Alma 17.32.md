[Alma 17:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water.
