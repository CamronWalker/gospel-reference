[Alma 17:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.
