[Alma 17:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/17?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And they had been teaching the word of God for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him.
