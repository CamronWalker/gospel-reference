[Alma 19:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name. Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit.
