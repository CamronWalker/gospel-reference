[Alma 19:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing--that their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do evil.
