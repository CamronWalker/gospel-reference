[Alma 19:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name.
