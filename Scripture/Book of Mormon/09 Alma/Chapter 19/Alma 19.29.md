[Alma 19:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people!
