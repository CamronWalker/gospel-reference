[Alma 19:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword of Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.
