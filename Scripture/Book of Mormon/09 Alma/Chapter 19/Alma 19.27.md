[Alma 19:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/19?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites.
