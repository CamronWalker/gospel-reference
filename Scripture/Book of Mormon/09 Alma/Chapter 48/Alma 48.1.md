[Alma 48:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites.
