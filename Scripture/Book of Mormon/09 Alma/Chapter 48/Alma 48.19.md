[Alma 48:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto their words.
