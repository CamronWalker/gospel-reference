[Alma 48:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.
