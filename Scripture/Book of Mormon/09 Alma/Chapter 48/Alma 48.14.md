[Alma 48:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/48?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.
