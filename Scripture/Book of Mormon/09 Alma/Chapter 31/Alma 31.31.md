[Alma 31:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may have strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people.
