[Alma 31:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.
