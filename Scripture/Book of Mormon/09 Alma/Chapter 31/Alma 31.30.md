[Alma 31:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this people? O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities. For I am infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul.
