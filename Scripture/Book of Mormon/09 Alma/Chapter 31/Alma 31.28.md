[Alma 31:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say--We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.
