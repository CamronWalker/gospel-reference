[Alma 31:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.
