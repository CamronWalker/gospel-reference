[Alma 31:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world.
