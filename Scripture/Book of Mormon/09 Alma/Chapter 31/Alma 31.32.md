[Alma 31:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are with me--yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons--yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ.
