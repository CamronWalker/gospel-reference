[Alma 31:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just--yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them--therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.
