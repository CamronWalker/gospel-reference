[Alma 47:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness.
