[Alma 47:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.
