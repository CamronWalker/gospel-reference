[Alma 47:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.
