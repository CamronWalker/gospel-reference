[Alma 47:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.
