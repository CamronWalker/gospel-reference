[Alma 47:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him.
