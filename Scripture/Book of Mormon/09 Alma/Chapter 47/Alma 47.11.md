[Alma 47:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.
