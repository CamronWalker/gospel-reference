[Alma 47:34](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p34#p34) And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against them? And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of the king.
