[Alma 60:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Behold, could ye suppose that ye could sit upon your thrones, and because of the exceeding goodness of God ye could do nothing and he would deliver you? Behold, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain.
