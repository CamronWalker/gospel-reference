[Alma 60:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Behold it is time, yea, the time is now at hand, that except ye do bestir yourselves in the defence of your country and your little ones, the sword of justice doth hang over you; yea, and it shall fall upon you and visit you even to your utter destruction.
