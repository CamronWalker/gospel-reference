[Alma 60:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) Yea, even they who have looked up to you for protection, yea, have placed you in a situation that ye might have succored them, yea, ye might have sent armies unto them, to have strengthened them, and have saved thousands of them from falling by the sword.
