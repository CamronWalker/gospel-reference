[Alma 60:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) Yea, behold I do not fear your power nor your authority, but it is my God whom I fear; and it is according to his commandments that I do take my sword to defend the cause of my country, and it is because of your iniquity that we have suffered so much loss.
