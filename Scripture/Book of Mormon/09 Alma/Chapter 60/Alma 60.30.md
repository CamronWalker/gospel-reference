[Alma 60:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) Behold, I wait for assistance from you; and, except ye do administer unto our relief, behold, I come unto you, even in the land of Zarahemla, and smite you with the sword, insomuch that ye can have no more power to impede the progress of this people in the cause of our freedom.
