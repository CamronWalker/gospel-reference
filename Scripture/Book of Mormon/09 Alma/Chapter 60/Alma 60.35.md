[Alma 60:35](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p35#p35) And behold, if ye will not do this I come unto you speedily; for behold, God will not suffer that we should perish with hunger; therefore he will give unto us of your food, even if it must be by the sword. Now see that ye fulfil the word of God.
