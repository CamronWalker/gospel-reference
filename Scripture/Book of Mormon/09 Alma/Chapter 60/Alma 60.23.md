[Alma 60:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) Do ye suppose that God will look upon you as guiltless while ye sit still and behold these things? Behold I say unto you, Nay. Now I would that ye should remember that God has said that the inward vessel shall be cleansed first, and then shall the outer vessel be cleansed also.
