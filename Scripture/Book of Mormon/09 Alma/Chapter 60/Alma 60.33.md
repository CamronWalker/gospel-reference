[Alma 60:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) Ye know that ye do transgress the laws of God, and ye do know that ye do trample them under your feet. Behold, the Lord saith unto me: If those whom ye have appointed your governors do not repent of their sins and iniquities, ye shall go up to battle against them.
