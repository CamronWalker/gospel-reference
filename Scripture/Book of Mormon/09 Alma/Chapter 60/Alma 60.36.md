[Alma 60:36](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p36#p36) Behold, I am Moroni, your chief captain. I seek not for power, but to pull it down. I seek not for honor of the world, but for the glory of my God, and the freedom and welfare of my country. And thus I close mine epistle.
