[Alma 60:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God.
