[Alma 60:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/60?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And I will come unto you, and if there be any among you that has a desire for freedom, yea, if there be even a spark of freedom remaining, behold I will stir up insurrections among you, even until those who have desires to usurp power and authority shall become extinct.
