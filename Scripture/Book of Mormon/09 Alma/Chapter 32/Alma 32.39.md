[Alma 32:39](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p39#p39) Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.
