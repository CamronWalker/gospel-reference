[Alma 32:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed--yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.
