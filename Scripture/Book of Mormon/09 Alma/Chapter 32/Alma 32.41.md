[Alma 32:41](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p41#p41) But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.
