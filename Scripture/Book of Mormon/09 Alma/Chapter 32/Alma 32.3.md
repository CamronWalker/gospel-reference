[Alma 32:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.
