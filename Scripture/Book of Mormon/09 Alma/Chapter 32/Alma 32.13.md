[Alma 32:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.
