[Alma 32:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.
