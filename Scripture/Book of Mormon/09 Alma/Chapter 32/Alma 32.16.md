[Alma 32:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.
