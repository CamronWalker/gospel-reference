[Alma 32:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.
