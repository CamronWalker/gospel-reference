[Alma 32:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.
