[Alma 32:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.
