[Alma 32:38](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p38#p38) But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.
