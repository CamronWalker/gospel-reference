[Alma 32:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.
