[Alma 44:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the wilderness.
