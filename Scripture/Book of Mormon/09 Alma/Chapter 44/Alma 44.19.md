[Alma 44:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again against them.
