[Alma 44:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.
