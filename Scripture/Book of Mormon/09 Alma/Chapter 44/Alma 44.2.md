[Alma 44:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.
