[Alma 44:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people. And he took the weapons of war from the Lamanites; and after they had entered into a covenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the wilderness.
