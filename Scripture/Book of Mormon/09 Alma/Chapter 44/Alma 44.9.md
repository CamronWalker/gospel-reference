[Alma 44:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cunning that has preserved you from our swords. Behold, it is your breastplates and your shields that have preserved you.
