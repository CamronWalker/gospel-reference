[Alma 44:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.
