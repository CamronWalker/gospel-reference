[Alma 44:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/44?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us.
