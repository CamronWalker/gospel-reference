[Alma 53:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors.
