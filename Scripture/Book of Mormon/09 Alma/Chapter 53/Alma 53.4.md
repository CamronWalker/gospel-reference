[Alma 53:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.
