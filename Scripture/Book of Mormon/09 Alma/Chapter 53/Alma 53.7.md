[Alma 53:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and providing food for their armies.
