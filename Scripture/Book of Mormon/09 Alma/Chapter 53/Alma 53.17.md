[Alma 53:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.
