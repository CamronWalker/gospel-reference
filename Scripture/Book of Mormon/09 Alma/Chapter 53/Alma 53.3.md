[Alma 53:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the land, or the city, Bountiful.
