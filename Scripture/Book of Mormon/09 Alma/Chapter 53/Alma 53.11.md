[Alma 53:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them.
