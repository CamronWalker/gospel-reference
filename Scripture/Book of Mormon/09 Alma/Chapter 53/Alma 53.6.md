[Alma 53:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the city of Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.
