[Alma 53:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.
