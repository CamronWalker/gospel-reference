[Alma 53:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.
