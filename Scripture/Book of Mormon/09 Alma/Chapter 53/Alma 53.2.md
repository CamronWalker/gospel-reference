[Alma 53:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/53?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other's safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.
