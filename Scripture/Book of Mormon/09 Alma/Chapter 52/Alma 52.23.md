[Alma 52:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/52?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers. And as Teancum saw the armies of the Lamanites coming out against him he began to retreat down by the seashore, northward.
