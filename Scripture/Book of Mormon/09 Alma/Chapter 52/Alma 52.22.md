[Alma 52:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/52?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader.
