[Alma 52:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/52?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that Teancum made preparations to make an attack upon the city of Mulek, and march forth with his army against the Lamanites; but he saw that it was impossible that he could overpower them while they were in their fortifications; therefore he abandoned his designs and returned again to the city Bountiful, to wait for the coming of Moroni, that he might receive strength to his army.
