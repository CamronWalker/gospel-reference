[Alma 29:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) Yea, and I know that good and evil have come before all men; he that knoweth not good from evil is blameless; but he that knoweth good and evil, to him it is given according to his desires, whether he desireth good or evil, life or death, joy or remorse of conscience.
