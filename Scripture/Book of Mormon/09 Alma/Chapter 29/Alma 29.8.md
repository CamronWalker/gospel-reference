[Alma 29:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For behold, the Lord doth grant unto all nations, of their own nation and tongue, to teach his word, yea, in wisdom, all that he seeth fit that they should have; therefore we see that the Lord doth counsel in wisdom, according to that which is just and true.
