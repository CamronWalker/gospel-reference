[Alma 29:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.
