[Alma 29:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) I ought not to harrow up in my desires, the firm decree of a just God, for I know that he granteth unto men according to their desire, whether it be unto death or unto life; yea, I know that he allotteth unto men, yea, decreeth unto them decrees which are unalterable, according to their wills, whether they be unto salvation or unto destruction.
