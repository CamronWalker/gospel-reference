[Alma 29:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/29?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.
