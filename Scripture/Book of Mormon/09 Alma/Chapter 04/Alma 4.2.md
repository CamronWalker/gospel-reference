[Alma 4:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.
