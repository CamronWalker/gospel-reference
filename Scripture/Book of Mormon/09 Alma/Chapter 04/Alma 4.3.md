[Alma 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.
