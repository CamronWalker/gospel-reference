[Alma 4:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.
