[Alma 4:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.
