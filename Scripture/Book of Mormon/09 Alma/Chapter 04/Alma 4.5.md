[Alma 4:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/4?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass in the seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.
