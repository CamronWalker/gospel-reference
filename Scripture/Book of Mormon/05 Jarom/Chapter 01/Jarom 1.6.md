[Jarom 1:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and the Lamanites also. And they were exceedingly more numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the blood of beasts.
