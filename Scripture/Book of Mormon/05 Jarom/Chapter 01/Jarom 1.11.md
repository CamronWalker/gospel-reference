[Jarom 1:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the people to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was. And after this manner did they teach them.
