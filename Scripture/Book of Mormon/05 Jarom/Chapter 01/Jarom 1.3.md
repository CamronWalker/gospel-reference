[Jarom 1:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the face of the land.
