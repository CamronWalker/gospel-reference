[Jarom 1:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And I, Jarom, do not write more, for the plates are small. But behold, my brethren, ye can go to the other plates of Nephi; for behold, upon them the records of our wars are engraven, according to the writings of the kings, or those which they caused to be written.
