[Jarom 1:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the Nephites, to battle. But our kings and our leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our inheritance.
