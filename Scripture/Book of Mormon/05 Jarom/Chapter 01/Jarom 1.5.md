[Jarom 1:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And now, behold, two hundred years had passed away, and the people of Nephi had waxed strong in the land. They observed to keep the law of Moses and the sabbath day holy unto the Lord. And they profaned not; neither did they blaspheme. And the laws of the land were exceedingly strict.
