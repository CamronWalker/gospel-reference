[Jarom 1:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be destroyed from off the face of the land.
