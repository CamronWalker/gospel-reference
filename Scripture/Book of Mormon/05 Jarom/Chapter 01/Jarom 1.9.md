[Jarom 1:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/jarom/1?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us. But the word of the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land.
