[Mosiah 3:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.
