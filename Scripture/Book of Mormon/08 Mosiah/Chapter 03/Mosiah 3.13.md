[Mosiah 3:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.
