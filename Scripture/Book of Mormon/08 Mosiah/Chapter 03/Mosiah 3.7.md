[Mosiah 3:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.
