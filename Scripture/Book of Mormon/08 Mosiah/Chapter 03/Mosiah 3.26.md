[Mosiah 3:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more forever.
