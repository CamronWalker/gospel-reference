[Mosiah 3:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.
