[Mosiah 3:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.
