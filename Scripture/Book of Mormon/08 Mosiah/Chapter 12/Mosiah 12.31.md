[Mosiah 12:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And it shall come to pass that ye shall be smitten for your iniquities, for ye have said that ye teach the law of Moses. And what know ye concerning the law of Moses? Doth salvation come by the law of Moses? What say ye?
