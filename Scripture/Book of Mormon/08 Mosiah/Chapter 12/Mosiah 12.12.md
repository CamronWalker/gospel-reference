[Mosiah 12:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And again, he saith thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which, when it is fully ripe, if the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land. And he pretendeth the Lord hath spoken it. And he saith all this shall come upon thee except thou repent, and this because of thine iniquities.
