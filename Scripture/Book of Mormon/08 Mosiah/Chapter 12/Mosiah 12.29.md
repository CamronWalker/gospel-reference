[Mosiah 12:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/12?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) And again he said unto them: If ye teach the law of Moses why do ye not keep it? Why do ye set your hearts upon riches? Why do ye commit whoredoms and spend your strength with harlots, yea, and cause this people to commit sin, that the Lord has cause to send me to prophesy against this people, yea, even a great evil against this people?
