[Mosiah 20:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And it came to pass that they followed the king, and went forth without arms to meet the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did meet the Lamanites; and the king of the Lamanites did bow himself down before them, and did plead in behalf of the people of Limhi.
