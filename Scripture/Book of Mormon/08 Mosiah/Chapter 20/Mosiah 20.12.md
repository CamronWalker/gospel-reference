[Mosiah 20:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that they found the king of the Lamanites among the number of their dead; yet he was not dead, having been wounded and left upon the ground, so speedy was the flight of his people.
