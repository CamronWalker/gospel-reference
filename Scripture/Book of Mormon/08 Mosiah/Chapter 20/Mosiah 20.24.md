[Mosiah 20:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And it came to pass that the king was pacified towards his people; and he said unto them: Let us go forth to meet my people, without arms; and I swear unto you with an oath that my people shall not slay thy people.
