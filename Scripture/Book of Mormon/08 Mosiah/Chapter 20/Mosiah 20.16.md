[Mosiah 20:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And now Limhi had heard nothing concerning this matter; therefore he said: I will search among my people and whosoever has done this thing shall perish. Therefore he caused a search to be made among his people.
