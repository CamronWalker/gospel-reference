[Mosiah 20:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that the people of Limhi began to drive the Lamanites before them; yet they were not half so numerous as the Lamanites. But they fought for their lives, and for their wives, and for their children; therefore they exerted themselves and like dragons did they fight.
