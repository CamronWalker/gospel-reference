[Mosiah 20:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/20?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And now let us pacify the king, and we fulfil the oath which we have made unto him; for it is better that we should be in bondage than that we should lose our lives; therefore, let us put a stop to the shedding of so much blood.
