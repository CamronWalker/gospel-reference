[Mosiah 1:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/1?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.
