[Mosiah 10:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace. And I caused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.
