[Mosiah 10:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.
