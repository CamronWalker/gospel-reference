[Mosiah 10:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead. And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.
