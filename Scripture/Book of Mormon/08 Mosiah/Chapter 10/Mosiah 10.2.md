[Mosiah 10:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/10?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.
