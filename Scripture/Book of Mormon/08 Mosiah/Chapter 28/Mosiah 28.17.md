[Mosiah 28:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/28?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.
