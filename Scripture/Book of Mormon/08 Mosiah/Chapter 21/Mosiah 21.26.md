[Mosiah 21:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry bones; yea, a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the coming of Ammon.
