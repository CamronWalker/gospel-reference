[Mosiah 21:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled into the wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come upon them.
