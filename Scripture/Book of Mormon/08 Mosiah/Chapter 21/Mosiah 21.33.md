[Mosiah 21:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had authority from God. And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself an unworthy servant.
