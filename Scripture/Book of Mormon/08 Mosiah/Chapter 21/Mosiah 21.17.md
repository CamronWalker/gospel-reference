[Mosiah 21:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should impart to the support of the widows and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.
