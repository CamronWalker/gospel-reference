[Mosiah 21:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.
