[Mosiah 9:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/9?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers' first inheritance, and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them--but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.
