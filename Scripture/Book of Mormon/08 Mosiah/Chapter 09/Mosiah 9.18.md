[Mosiah 9:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/9?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.
