[Mosiah 24:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.
