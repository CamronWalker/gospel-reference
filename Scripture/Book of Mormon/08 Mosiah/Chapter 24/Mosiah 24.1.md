[Mosiah 24:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.
