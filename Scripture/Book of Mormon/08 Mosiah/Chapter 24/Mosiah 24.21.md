[Mosiah 24:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks to God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God.
