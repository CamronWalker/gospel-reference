[Mosiah 24:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.
