[Mosiah 24:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way in the wilderness.
