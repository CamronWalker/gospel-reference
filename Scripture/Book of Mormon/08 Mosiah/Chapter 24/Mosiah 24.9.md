[Mosiah 24:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them.
