[Mosiah 16:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) But remember that he that persists in his own carnal nature, and goes on in the ways of sin and rebellion against God, remaineth in his fallen state and the devil hath all power over him. Therefore, he is as though there was no redemption made, being an enemy to God; and also is the devil an enemy to God.
