[Mosiah 16:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Having gone according to their own carnal wills and desires; having never called upon the Lord while the arms of mercy were extended towards them; for the arms of mercy were extended towards them, and they would not; they being warned of their iniquities and yet they would not depart from them; and they were commanded to repent and yet they would not repent.
