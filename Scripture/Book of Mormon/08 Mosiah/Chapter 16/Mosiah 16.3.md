[Mosiah 16:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) For they are carnal and devilish, and the devil has power over them; yea, even that old serpent that did beguile our first parents, which was the cause of their fall; which was the cause of all mankind becoming carnal, sensual, devilish, knowing evil from good, subjecting themselves to the devil.
