[Mosiah 16:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/16?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And then shall the wicked be cast out, and they shall have cause to howl, and weep, and wail, and gnash their teeth; and this because they would not hearken unto the voice of the Lord; therefore the Lord redeemeth them not.
