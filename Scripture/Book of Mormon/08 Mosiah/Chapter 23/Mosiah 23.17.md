[Mosiah 23:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from God. Therefore he consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were consecrated except they were just men.
