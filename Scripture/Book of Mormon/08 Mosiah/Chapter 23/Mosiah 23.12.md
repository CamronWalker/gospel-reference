[Mosiah 23:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.
