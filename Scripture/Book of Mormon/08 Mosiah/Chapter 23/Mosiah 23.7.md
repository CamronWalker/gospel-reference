[Mosiah 23:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should have a king.
