[Mosiah 4:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.
