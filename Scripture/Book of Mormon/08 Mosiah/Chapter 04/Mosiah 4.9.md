[Mosiah 4:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.
