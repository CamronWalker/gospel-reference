[Mosiah 4:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.
