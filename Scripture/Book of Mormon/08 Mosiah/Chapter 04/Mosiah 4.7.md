[Mosiah 4:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.
