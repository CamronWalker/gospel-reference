[Mosiah 4:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.
