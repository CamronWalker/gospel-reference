[Mosiah 4:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.
