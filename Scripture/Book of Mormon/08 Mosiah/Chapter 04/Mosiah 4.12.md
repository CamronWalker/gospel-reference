[Mosiah 4:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.
