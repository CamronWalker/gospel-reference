[Mosiah 4:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.
