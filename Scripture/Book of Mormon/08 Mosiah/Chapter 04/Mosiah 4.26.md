[Mosiah 4:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you--that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God--I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.
