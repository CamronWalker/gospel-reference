[Mosiah 4:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.
