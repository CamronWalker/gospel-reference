[Mosiah 8:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.
