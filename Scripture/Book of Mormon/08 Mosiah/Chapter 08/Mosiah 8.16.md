[Mosiah 8:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.
