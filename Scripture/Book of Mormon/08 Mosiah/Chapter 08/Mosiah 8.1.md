[Mosiah 8:1](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng&id=p1#p1) And it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.
