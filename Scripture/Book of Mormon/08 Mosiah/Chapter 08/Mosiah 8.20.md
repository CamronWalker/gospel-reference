[Mosiah 8:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/8?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!
