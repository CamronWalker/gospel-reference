[Mosiah 29:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land, especially among this my people; but I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face of the land.
