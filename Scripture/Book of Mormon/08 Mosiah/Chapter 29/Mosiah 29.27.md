[Mosiah 29:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.
