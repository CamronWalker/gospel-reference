[Mosiah 29:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it all unto them.
