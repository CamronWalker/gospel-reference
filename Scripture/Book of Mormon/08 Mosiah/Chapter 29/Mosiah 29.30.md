[Mosiah 29:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king; that if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be answered upon their own heads.
