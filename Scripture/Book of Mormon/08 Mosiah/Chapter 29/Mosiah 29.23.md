[Mosiah 29:23](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p23#p23) And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.
