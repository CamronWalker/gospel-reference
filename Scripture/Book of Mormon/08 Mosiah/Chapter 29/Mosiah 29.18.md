[Mosiah 29:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and also the wickedness and abominations of his people. Behold what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of their iniquities they were brought into bondage.
