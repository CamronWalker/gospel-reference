[Mosiah 29:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.
