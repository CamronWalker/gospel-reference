[Mosiah 29:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people--I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you.
