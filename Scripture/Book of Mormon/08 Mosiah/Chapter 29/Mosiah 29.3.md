[Mosiah 29:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom.
