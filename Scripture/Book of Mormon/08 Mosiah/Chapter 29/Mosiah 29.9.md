[Mosiah 29:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin.
