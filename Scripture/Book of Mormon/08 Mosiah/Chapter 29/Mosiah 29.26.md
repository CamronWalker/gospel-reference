[Mosiah 29:26](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/29?lang=eng&id=p26#p26) Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law--to do your business by the voice of the people.
