[Mosiah 22:6](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/22?lang=eng&id=p6#p6) Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.
