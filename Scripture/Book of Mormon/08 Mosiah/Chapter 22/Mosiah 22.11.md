[Mosiah 22:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/22?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.
