[Mosiah 2:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.
