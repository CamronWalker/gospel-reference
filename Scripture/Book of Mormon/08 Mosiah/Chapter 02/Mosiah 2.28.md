[Mosiah 2:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.
