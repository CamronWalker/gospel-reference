[Mosiah 2:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day.
