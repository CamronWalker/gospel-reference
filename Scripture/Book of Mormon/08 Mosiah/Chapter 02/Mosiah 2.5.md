[Mosiah 2:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.
