[Mosiah 2:33](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p33#p33) For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.
