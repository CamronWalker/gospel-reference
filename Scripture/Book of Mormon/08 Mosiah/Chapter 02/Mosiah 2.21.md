[Mosiah 2:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another--I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.
