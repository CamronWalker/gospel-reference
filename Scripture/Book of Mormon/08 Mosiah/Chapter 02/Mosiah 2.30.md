[Mosiah 2:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.
