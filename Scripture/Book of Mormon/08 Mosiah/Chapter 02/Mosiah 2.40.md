[Mosiah 2:40](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p40#p40) O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.
