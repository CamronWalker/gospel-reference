[Mosiah 2:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.
