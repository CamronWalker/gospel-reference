[Mosiah 2:37](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p37#p37) I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.
