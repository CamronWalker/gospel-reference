[Mosiah 2:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne--and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.
