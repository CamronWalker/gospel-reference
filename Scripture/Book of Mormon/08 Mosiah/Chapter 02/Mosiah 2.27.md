[Mosiah 2:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.
