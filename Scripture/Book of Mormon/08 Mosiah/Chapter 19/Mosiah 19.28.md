[Mosiah 19:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/19?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) And the king of the Lamanites set guards round about the land, that he might keep the people of Limhi in the land, that they might not depart into the wilderness; and he did support his guards out of the tribute which he did receive from the Nephites.
