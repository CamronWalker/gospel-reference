[Mosiah 19:19](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/19?lang=eng&id=p19#p19) Now they had sworn in their hearts that they would return to the land of Nephi, and if their wives and their children were slain, and also those that had tarried with them, that they would seek revenge, and also perish with them.
