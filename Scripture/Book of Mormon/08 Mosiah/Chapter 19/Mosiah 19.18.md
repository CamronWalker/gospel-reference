[Mosiah 19:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/19?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) And it came to pass that Gideon sent men into the wilderness secretly, to search for the king and those that were with him. And it came to pass that they met the people in the wilderness, all save the king and his priests.
