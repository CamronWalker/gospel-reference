[Mosiah 25:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the people of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came with him into the wilderness.
