[Mosiah 25:18](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&id=p18#p18) Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.
