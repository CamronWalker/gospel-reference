[Mosiah 25:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/25?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until they returned again.
