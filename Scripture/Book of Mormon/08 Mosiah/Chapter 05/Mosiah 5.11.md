[Mosiah 5:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.
