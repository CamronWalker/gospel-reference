[Mosiah 5:7](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p7#p7) And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.
