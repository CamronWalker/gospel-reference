[Mosiah 5:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And we are willing to enter into a covenant with our God to do his will, and to be obedient to his commandments in all things that he shall command us, all the remainder of our days, that we may not bring upon ourselves a never-ending torment, as has been spoken by the angel, that we may not drink out of the cup of the wrath of God.
