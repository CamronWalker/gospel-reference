[Mosiah 5:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.
