[Mosiah 5:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.
