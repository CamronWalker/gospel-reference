[Mosiah 5:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.
