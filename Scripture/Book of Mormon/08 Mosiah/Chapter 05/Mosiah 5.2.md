[Mosiah 5:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.
