[Mosiah 13:3](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13?lang=eng&id=p3#p3) Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested that I should tell; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time.
