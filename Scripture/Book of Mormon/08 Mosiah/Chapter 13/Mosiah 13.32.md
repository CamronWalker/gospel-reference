[Mosiah 13:32](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13?lang=eng&id=p32#p32) And now, did they understand the law? I say unto you, Nay, they did not all understand the law; and this because of the hardness of their hearts; for they understood not that there could not any man be saved except it were through the redemption of God.
