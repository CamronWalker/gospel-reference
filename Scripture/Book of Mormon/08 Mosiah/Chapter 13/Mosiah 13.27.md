[Mosiah 13:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses. I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you, that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.
