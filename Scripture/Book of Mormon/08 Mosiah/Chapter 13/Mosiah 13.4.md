[Mosiah 13:4](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/13?lang=eng&id=p4#p4) But I must fulfil the commandments wherewith God has commanded me; and because I have told you the truth ye are angry with me. And again, because I have spoken the word of God ye have judged me that I am mad.
