[Mosiah 17:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain.
