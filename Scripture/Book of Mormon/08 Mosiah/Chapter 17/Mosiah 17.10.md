[Mosiah 17:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.
