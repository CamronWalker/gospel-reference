[Mosiah 17:8](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p8#p8) For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.
