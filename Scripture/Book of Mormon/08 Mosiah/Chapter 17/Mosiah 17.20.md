[Mosiah 17:20](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p20#p20) And now, when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.
