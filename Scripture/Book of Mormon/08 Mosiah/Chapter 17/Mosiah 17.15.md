[Mosiah 17:15](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/17?lang=eng&id=p15#p15) Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.
