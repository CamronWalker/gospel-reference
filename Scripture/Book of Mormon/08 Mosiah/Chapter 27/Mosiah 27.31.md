[Mosiah 27:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.
