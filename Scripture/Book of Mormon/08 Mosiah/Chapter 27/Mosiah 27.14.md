[Mosiah 27:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.
