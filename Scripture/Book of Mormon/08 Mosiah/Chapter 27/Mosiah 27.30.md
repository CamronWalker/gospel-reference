[Mosiah 27:30](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p30#p30) I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.
