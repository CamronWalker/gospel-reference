[Mosiah 27:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.
