[Mosiah 27:16](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p16#p16) Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.
