[Mosiah 27:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength--that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.
