[Mosiah 27:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.
