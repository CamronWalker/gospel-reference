[Mosiah 15:5](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p5#p5) And thus the flesh becoming subject to the Spirit, or the Son to the Father, being one God, suffereth temptation, and yieldeth not to the temptation, but suffereth himself to be mocked, and scourged, and cast out, and disowned by his people.
