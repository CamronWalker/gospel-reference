[Mosiah 15:21](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p21#p21) And there cometh a resurrection, even a first resurrection; yea, even a resurrection of those that have been, and who are, and who shall be, even until the resurrection of Christ--for so shall he be called.
