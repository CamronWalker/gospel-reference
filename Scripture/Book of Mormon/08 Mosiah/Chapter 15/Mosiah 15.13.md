[Mosiah 15:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) Yea, and are not the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began? I say unto you that they are his seed.
