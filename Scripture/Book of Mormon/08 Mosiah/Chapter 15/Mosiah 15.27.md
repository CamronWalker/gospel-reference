[Mosiah 15:27](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p27#p27) Therefore ought ye not to tremble? For salvation cometh to none such; for the Lord hath redeemed none such; yea, neither can the Lord redeem such; for he cannot deny himself; for he cannot deny justice when it has its claim.
