[Mosiah 15:24](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p24#p24) And these are those who have part in the first resurrection; and these are they that have died before Christ came, in their ignorance, not having salvation declared unto them. And thus the Lord bringeth about the restoration of these; and they have a part in the first resurrection, or have eternal life, being redeemed by the Lord.
