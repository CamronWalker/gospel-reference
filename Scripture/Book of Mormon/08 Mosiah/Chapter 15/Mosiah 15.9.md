[Mosiah 15:9](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15?lang=eng&id=p9#p9) Having ascended into heaven, having the bowels of mercy; being filled with compassion towards the children of men; standing betwixt them and justice; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.
