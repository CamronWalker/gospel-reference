[Mosiah 26:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.
