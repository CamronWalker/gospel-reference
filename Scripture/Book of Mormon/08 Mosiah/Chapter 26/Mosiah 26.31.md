[Mosiah 26:31](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng&id=p31#p31) And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor's trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.
