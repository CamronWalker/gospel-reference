[Mosiah 26:11](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng&id=p11#p11) And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities. And they do not repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.
