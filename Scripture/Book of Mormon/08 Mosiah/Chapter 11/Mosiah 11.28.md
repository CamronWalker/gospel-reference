[Mosiah 11:28](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&id=p28#p28) I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay him.
