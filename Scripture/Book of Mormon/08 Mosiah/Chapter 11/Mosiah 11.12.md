[Mosiah 11:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.
