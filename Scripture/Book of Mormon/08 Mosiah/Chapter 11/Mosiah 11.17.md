[Mosiah 11:17](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&id=p17#p17) And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to exercise their hatred upon them.
