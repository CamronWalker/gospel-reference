[Mosiah 11:2](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&id=p2#p2) For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.
