[Mosiah 11:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.
