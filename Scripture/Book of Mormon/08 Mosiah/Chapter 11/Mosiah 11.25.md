[Mosiah 11:25](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/11?lang=eng&id=p25#p25) And except they repent in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God, I will not hear their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions; and thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me.
