[Mosiah 7:22](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&id=p22#p22) And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.
