[Mosiah 7:29](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&id=p29#p29) For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.
