[Mosiah 7:13](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&id=p13#p13) For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands. For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land.
