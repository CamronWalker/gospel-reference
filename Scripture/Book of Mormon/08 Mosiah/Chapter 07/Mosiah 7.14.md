[Mosiah 7:14](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/7?lang=eng&id=p14#p14) And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.
