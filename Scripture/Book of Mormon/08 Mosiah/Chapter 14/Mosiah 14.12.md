[Mosiah 14:12](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng&id=p12#p12) Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
