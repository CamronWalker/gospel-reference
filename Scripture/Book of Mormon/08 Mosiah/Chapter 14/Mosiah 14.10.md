[Mosiah 14:10](https://churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng&id=p10#p10) Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.
